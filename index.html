Privacy is an essential part of the web. This document provides definitions
for privacy and related concepts that are applicable worldwide as well as a set of privacy
principles that should guide the development of the web as a trustworthy platform. People using
the web would benefit from a stronger relationship between technology and policy, and this
document is written to work with both.

This document is a Draft Finding of the [Technical Architecture Group (TAG)](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/)
which we are releasing as a Draft Note. The intent is for this document to become a W3C Statement.
It was prepared by the [Web Privacy Principles Task Force](https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles),
which was convened by the TAG. Publication as a Draft Finding or Draft Note does not imply
endorsement by the TAG or by the W3C Membership.

The substance of this draft reflects the consensus of the TAG, but it is subject to ongoing
editorial work and restructuring. Please bear this in mind when citing or linking
to this document, as section numbers and headings may change.

This document is considered stable by the TAG and is ready for wide review.

## How This Document Fits In

This document elaborates on the [privacy principle](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/ethical-web-principles/#privacy)
from the [[[Ethical-Web]]]: "Security and privacy are essential." While it focuses on privacy, this should
not be taken as an indication that privacy is always more important than other ethical web principles, and
this document doesn't address how to balance the different ethical web principles if they come into conflict.

Privacy on the web is primarily regulated by two forces: the architectural capabilities that the web
platform exposes (or does not expose), and laws in the various jurisdictions where the web is used
([[New-Chicago-School]], [[Standard-Bodies-Regulators]]). These regulatory mechanisms are separate; a law in one country does not
(and should not) change the architecture of the whole web, and likewise web specifications cannot
override any given law (although they can affect how easy it is to create and enforce law). The web
is not merely an implementation of a particular legal privacy regime; it has distinct features and
guarantees driven by shared values that often exceed legal requirements for privacy.

However, the overall goal of privacy on the web is served best when technology and law complement
each other. This document seeks to establish shared concepts as an aid to technical efforts to
regulate privacy on the web. It may also be useful in pursuing alignment with and between legal
regulatory regimes.

Our goal for this document is not to cover all possible privacy issues, but rather to provide enough
background to support the web community in making informed decisions about privacy and in weaving
privacy into the architecture of the web.

Few architectural principles are absolute, and privacy is no exception: privacy can come into tension
with other desirable properties of an ethical architecture, and when that happens the web community
will have to work together to strike the right balance.

## Audiences for this Document {#audience}

The primary audiences for this document are

 * browser developers,
 * authors of web specifications,
 * reviewers of web specifications, and
 * web developers.

Additional audiences include:

 * policy makers and
 * operators of privacy-related services.

This document is intended to help its audiences address privacy concerns as early as possible in the life
cycle of a new web standard or feature, or in the development of web products. Beginning with privacy in mind will help avoid the need to
add special cases later to address unforeseen but predictable issues or
to build systems that turn out to be unacceptable to users.

Because this document guides privacy reviews of new standards, authors of web
specifications should consult it early in the design to make sure their feature
passes the review smoothly.

# An Introduction to Privacy on the Web {#intro}

This is a document containing technical guidelines. However, in order to put those guidelines in context we
must first define some terms and explain what we mean by privacy.

The web is a social and technical system made up of [=information flows=]. Because this document
is specifically about [=privacy=] as it applies to the web, it focuses on privacy with respect to
information flows.

The web is for everyone ([[?For-Everyone]]). It should be "<i>a platform that helps people and provides a
net positive social benefit</i>" ([[?ETHICAL-WEB]]). One of the ways in which the
web serves people is by seeking to protect them from surveillance and the types of manipulation that data can
enable.

Information can be used to predict and to influence people, as well as to design online
spaces that control people's behaviour. The collection and [=processing=] of information in greater
volume, with greater precision and reliability, with increasing interoperability across a growing
variety of data types, and at intensifying speed is leading to a concentration of power that threatens
private and public liberties. What's more, automation and the increasing computerisation of all aspects
of our lives both increase the power of information and decrease the cost of a number of intrusive
behaviours that would be more easily kept in check if the perpetrator had to be in the same room as
the victim.

When an [=actor=] can collect [=data=] about a [=person=] and process it automatically, and that
[=person=] has to take manual action to protect their [=data=] or control its processing, this <dfn>automation asymmetry</dfn>
creates an imbalance of power that favors that [=actor=] and decreases the [=person=]'s agency.
This document focuses on the impact that [=data=] [=processing=] can have on people, but it can also
impact other [=actors=], such as companies or governments.

It is important to keep in mind that not all people are equal in how they can resist
an imbalance of power: some [=people=] are more [=vulnerable=] and therefore in greater
need of protection.

<dfn data-lt="governance">Data governance</dfn> is the system of principles that regulate [=information flows=].
[=Data governance=] determines
which [=actors=] can collect [=data=], what data they can collect, how they can collect it, and how they can [=process=] it
([[?GKC-Privacy]], [[?IAD]]). This document provides building blocks for [=data governance=]
that puts [=people=] first.

Principles vary from [=context=] to [=context=] ([[?Understanding-Privacy]], [[?Contextual-Integrity]]).
For instance, people have different expectations of [=privacy=] at work, at a café, or at home. Understanding and
evaluating a privacy situation is best done by clearly identifying:

* Its [=actors=], which include the subject of the information as well as the sender and the recipient
  of the [=information flow=]. (Note that recipients might not always want to be recipients.)
* The type of data involved in the [=information flow=].
* The principles that are in use in this context.

There are <em>always</em> privacy principles at work. Some sets of principles may be more
permissive, but that does not make them neutral. All privacy principles have an impact on
[=people=] and we must therefore determine which principles best align with ethical web values in
web [=contexts=] ([[?ETHICAL-WEB]], [[?Why-Privacy]]).

<dfn>Information flows</dfn> are information exchanged or processed by
[=actors=]. A person's privacy can be harmed both by their information flowing from them to
other actors and by information flowing toward them. Examples of the latter include:
unexpected shocking images,
loud noises while they intend to sleep, manipulative information, interruptive
messages when their focus is on something else, or harassment when they seek social interactions.
(In some of these cases, the information may not be [=personal data=].)

On the web, [=information flows=] may involve a wide variety of [=actors=] that are not always
recognizable or obvious to a user within a particular interaction. Visiting a website may involve
the actors that contribute to operating that site, but also actors with network access,
which may include: Internet service providers; other network operators; local institutions providing
a network connection including schools, libraries, or universities; government intelligence services;
malicious hackers who have gained access to the network or the systems of any of the other actors.
High-level threats including [=surveillance=] may be pursued by these actors. Pervasive monitoring,
a form of large-scale, indiscriminate surveillance, is a known attack on the privacy of users of the
internet and the web [[RFC7258]].

Information flows may also involve other people &mdash; for example, other users of a site &mdash;
which could include friends, family members, teachers, strangers, or government officials. Some
threats to privacy, including both [=disclosure=] and harassment, may be particular to the other
people involved in the information flow.

## Individual Autonomy {#autonomy}

A [=person=]'s <dfn data-lt="autonomous">autonomy</dfn> is their ability to make decisions of their own personal will,
without undue influence from other [=actors=]. People have limited intellectual resources and
time with which to weigh decisions, and they have to rely on shortcuts when making decisions. This makes it possible
to manipulate their preferences, including their privacy preferences ([[?Privacy-Behavior]], [[?Digital-Market-Manipulation]]).
A [=person=]'s [=autonomy=] is improved by a system when that system offers a shortcut that is closer to what
that [=person=] would have decided given unlimited time and intellectual ability. [=Autonomy=] is decreased
when a similar shortcut goes against decisions made under these ideal conditions.

Affordances and interactions that decrease [=autonomy=] are known as <dfn data-lt="dark pattern|dark patterns">deceptive patterns</dfn> (or dark patterns).
A [=deceptive pattern=] does not have to be intentional ([[?Dark-Patterns]], [[?Dark-Pattern-Dark]]).
When building something that may impact people's [=autonomy=], it is important that reviewers
from multiple independent perspectives check that it does not introduce [=deceptive patterns=].

Given the large volume of potential [=data=]-related decisions in today's data economy,
it is impossible for people to have detailed control over how their data is processed.
This fact does not imply that privacy is dead. Studies show that
[=people=] remain concerned over how their [=data=] is [=processed=], that they feel powerless,
and sense that they have lost agency ([[?Privacy-Concerned]]). If we design our technological infrastructure
carefully, we can give people greater [=autonomy=] with respect to their own [=data=]. This is
done by setting [=appropriate=], privacy-protective defaults and designing user-friendly choice
architectures.

### Opt-in, Consent, Opt-out, Global Controls {#opt-in-out}

Several kinds of mechanisms exist to enable [=people=] to control how they interact
with data-processing systems. Mechanisms that increase the number of [=purposes=] for which
their [=data=] is being [=processed=] or the amount of their [=data=] that is [=processed=]
are referred to as [=opt-in=] or <dfn data-lt="opt in|opt-in">consent</dfn>. Mechanisms
that decrease this number of [=purposes=] or the amount of [=data=] being [=processed=] are known as
<dfn data-lt="opt out">opt-out</dfn>.

When deployed thoughtfully, these mechanisms can improve [=people=]'s [=autonomy=]. Often,
however, they are used as a way to avoid putting in the difficult work of deciding which
types of [=processing=] are [=appropriate=] and which are not, offloading [=privacy labour=]
to the people using a system.

[=People=] should be able to [=consent=] to data sharing that would
otherwise be restricted, such as granting access to their pictures or geolocation.
[=Actors=] need to take care that their users are [*informed*](#consent-principles) when
granting this [=consent=] and *aware* enough about what's going on that they can know to
revoke their consent when they want to.
[=Consent=] to data processing and granting permissions to access web platform APIs are
similar problems. Both consent and permissions should be requested in a way that lets
people delay or avoid answering if they're trying to do something else. If the user
grants some form of persistent access to data, there should be an indicator that lets
people notice this ongoing access and that lets them turn it off whenever they wish to.
In general, providing [=consent=] should be rare, intentional, and temporary.

When an [=opt-out=] mechanism exists, it should preferably work with a
<dfn>global opt-out</dfn> mechanism. Conceptually, a [=global opt-out=] mechanism is an
automaton operating as part of the [=user agent=]. It is equivalent to a robot that would carry
out a [=person=]'s instructions by pressing an [=opt-out=] button (or a similar expression of
the [=person=]'s rights) with every interaction that the [=person=] has with a site. (For
instance, the [=person=] may be objecting to [=processing=] based on legitimate interest,
withdrawing [=consent=] to specific [=purposes=], or requesting that their data not be sold or
shared.) The [=user=] is effectively delegating the expression of their [=opt-out=] to their
[=user agent=], which helps rectify [=automation asymmetry=]. The <em>Global Privacy
Control</em> [[?GPC]] is a good example of a [=global opt-out=] mechanism.

Under this model, a [=global opt-out=] signal should not be understood as a decision that a
[=person=] made a while ago when they flipped a setting or chose to use a specific
[=user agent=] but rather as a preference that they have chosen to automatically reaffirm with
every interaction with the site.

One implementation strategy for [=opt-outs=] or other <a href="#data-rights">data rights</a> is
to assign [=people=] stable [=identifiers=] and to maintain a central registry to map these
[=identifiers=] to [=people=]'s preferences. [=Actors=] that wish to process a given person's
data are then expected to fetch that person's preferences from the central registry and to
configure their processing accordingly. This approach has notably been deployed to capture
[=opt-outs=] of marketing uses of people's phone numbers or residential addresses. This
approach is not recommended, for multiple reasons: it offers no technical protection against
bad actors, it creates one central point of failure, it is hard to meaningfully audit (particularly
for the scale of processing implied by web systems), and experience with existing systems
shows that they make it hard for [=people=] to exercise their rights.

### Privacy Labour {#privacy-labour}

<dfn data-lt="privacy labor|labour|labor">Privacy labour</dfn> is the practice of having a [=person=] do
the work of ensuring [=data processing=] of which they are the subject or recipient is
[=appropriate=], instead of putting the responsibility on the [=actors=] who are doing the processing.
Data systems that are based on asking [=people=] for their [=consent=] tend to increase
[=privacy labour=].

More generally, implementations of [=privacy=] often offload [=labour=] to [=people=]. This is
notably true of the regimes descended from the <dfn data-lt="FIPs">Fair Information Practices</dfn>
([=FIPs=]), a loose set of principles initially elaborated in the 1970s in support of individual
[=autonomy=] in the face of growing concerns with databases. The [=FIPs=] generally assume that
there is sufficiently little [=data processing=] taking place that any [=person=] will be able to
carry out sufficient diligence to be [=autonomous=] in their decision-making. Since they offload
the [=privacy labour=] to people and assume perfect, unlimited [=autonomy=], the [=FIPs=] do not
forbid specific types of [=data processing=] but only place them under different procedural
requirements. This approach is no longer [=appropriate=].

One notable issue with procedural approaches to privacy is that they tend to have the same
requirements in situations where people find themselves in a significant asymmetry of
power with another [=actor=] — for instance a [=person=] using an essential service provided by a
monopolistic platform — and those where a person and the other [=actor=] are very much on equal
footing, or even where the [=person=] may have greater power, as is the case with small
businesses operating in a competitive environment. They also do not consider cases in
which one [=actor=] may coerce other [=actors=] into facilitating its [=inappropriate=]
practices, as is often the case with dominant players in advertising or in content aggregation
([[?Consent-Lackeys]], [[?CAT]]).

Reference to the [=FIPs=] survives to this day. They are often referenced as "<i>transparency
and choice</i>", which, in today's digital environment, is often an indication that
[=inappropriate=] [=processing=] is being described.

## Vulnerability {#vulnerability}

Sometimes particular groups of people, such as children, or the elderly,
are classified as [=vulnerable people=]. However, any [=person=] could be vulnerable in
one or more contexts, sometimes without realizing it.
A [=person=] may not realise when they disclose personal data that
they are vulnerable or could become vulnerable, and an [=actor=] may have
no way of knowing that a person is vulnerable.

Some individuals may be more vulnerable to privacy risks or harm as a result of
collection, misuse, loss, or theft of personal data because:

* of their attributes, interests, opinions, or behaviour;
* of the situation or setting (e.g. where there is information asymmetry or other
power imbalances);
* they lack the capacity to fully assess the risks;
* choices are not presented in an easy-to-understand meaningful way (e.g. [=deceptive
patterns=]);
* they have not been consulted about their privacy needs and expectations;
* they have not been considered in the decisions about the design of the
product or service.

Additional privacy protections may be needed for personal data of vulnerable
people or [sensitive information](#hl-sensitive-information) which could cause
someone to become vulnerable if their personal data is collected, used, or
shared (e.g. blocking tracking elements, sensor data, or information about
installed software or connected devices).

While sometimes others can help vulnerable people assess privacy risks and
make decisions about privacy (such as parents, [=guardians=], and peers), everyone
has their own right to privacy.

### Guardians {#guardians}

Some [vulnerable people](#vulnerability) need a <dfn>guardian</dfn> to help them make good
decisions about their own web use (e.g. children, with their parents often
acting as their [=guardians=]). A person with a [=guardian=] is known as
a <dfn>ward</dfn>.

The [=ward=] has a right to make informed decisions and exercise their
autonomy regarding their right to privacy. Their [=guardian=] has an
_obligation_ to help their [=ward=] do so when the [=ward=]'s abilities aren't
sufficient, even if that conflicts with the [=guardian=]'s desires. In
practice, many [=guardians=] do not make decisions in their [=ward=]'s best
interest, and it's critical that web platform technologies do not exacerbate
the risks inherent in this situation.

[=User agents=] should balance a benevolent [=guardian=]'s need to protect
their [=ward=] from dangers, against a [=ward=]'s need to protect themself
if they have a malicious [=guardian=].

[=User agents=] can protect vulnerable [=wards=] by complying with the principles in
[[[#device-administrators]]], and may only provide information about a [=ward=]
to a [=guardian=] for the purpose of helping that [=guardian=] uphold their
responsibilities to their [=ward=]. The mechanism for doing so must include
measures to help [=wards=] who realize that their [=guardian=] isn't acting in
the [=ward=]'s interest.

<aside class="example" id="example-protective-parent" title="Protective parents">

A parent might configure a small child's [=user agent=] to block access to violent content until the
child is old enough to make their own decisions about it.

</aside>

<aside class="example" id="example-lgbt-kid" title="An LGBT child">

A child may discover that they're LGBT and need to find supportive resources online. If they have a
homophobic or transphobic parent, that parent might have configured their [=user agent=] to either
block or inform the parent when the child visits web pages about LGBT-related subjects. The [=user
agent=] needs to warn the child about how it's configured so that the child can know to ask a better
[=guardian=] for access to the help they need.

</aside>

## Collective Governance {#collective}

Privacy principles are defined through social processes and, because of that, the applicable definition
of [=privacy=] in a given context can be
contested ([[?Privacy-Contested]]). This makes privacy a problem of collective action ([[?GKC-Privacy]]).
Group-level [=data processing=] may impact populations or individuals, including in
ways that [=people=] could not control even under the optimistic assumptions of [=consent=]. For instance,
it's possible that the only thing that a person is willing to reveal to a particular actor is that they
are part of a given group. However, other members of the same group may be interacting with the same
actor and revealing a lot more information, which can enable effective statistical inferences about
people who refrain from providing information about themselves.

What we consider is therefore not just the relation between the [=people=] who share data
and the [=actors=] that invite that sharing ([[?Relational-Turn]]), but also between the [=people=]
who may find themselves categorised indirectly as part of a group even without sharing data. One key
understanding here is that such relations may persist even when data is [=de-identified=]. What's
more, such categorisation of people, voluntary or not, changes the way in which the world operates.
This can produce self-reinforcing loops that can damage both individuals and
groups ([[?Seeing-Like-A-State]]).

In general, collective issues in [=data=] require collective solutions.
Web standards help with [=data governance=] by
defining structural controls in [=user agents=],
ensuring that researchers and regulators can discover group-level abuse,
and establishing or delegating to institutions that can handle issues of [=privacy=].
[=Governance=] will often struggle to achieve its goals if it works primarily by
increasing <em>individual</em> control instead of by collective action.

Collecting data at large scales can have significant pro-social outcomes. Problems tend to
emerge when [=actors=] [=process=] [=data=]
for collective benefit and for [=disloyal=] [=purposes=] at the same time.
The [=disloyal=] [=purposes=] are often justified as bankrolling the pro-social outcomes
but this requires collective oversight to be [=appropriate=].

### Group Privacy {#group-privacy}

There are different ways for [=people=] to become members of a group. Either they can join it
deliberately, making it a self-constituted group such as when joining a club, or they can be
classified into it by an external actor, typically a bureaucracy or its computerised equivalent
([[?Beyond-Individual]]). In the latter case, [=people=] may not be aware that they are being
grouped together, and the definition of the group may not be intelligible (for instance if it is
created from opaque machine learning techniques).

Protecting group privacy can take place at two different levels. The existence of a group or at
least its activities may need to be protected even in cases in which its members are guaranteed to
remain anonymous. We refer to this as "group privacy." Conversely, [=people=] may wish to protect
knowledge that they are members of the group even though the existence of the group and its actions
may be well known (e.g. membership in a dissidents movement under authoritarian rule), which we call
"membership privacy". An example [=privacy violation=] for the former case
is the fitness app Strava that did not reveal individual behaviour or legal identity but published heat
maps of popular running routes. In doing so, it revealed secret US bases around which military
personnel took frequent runs ([[?Strava-Debacle]], [[?Strava-Reveal-Military]]).

People's privacy interests may also be affected when information about a small group of people is
processed, even if no individualized data is exposed. For example, browsing activity of the students
in a classroom may be sensitive even if their teacher doesn't learn exactly which student accessed a
particular resource about a health issue. Targeting presentation of information to a small group may
also be inappropriate: for example, targeting messages to people who visited a particular clinic or
are empaneled on a particular jury may be invasive even without uniquely individual data.

When [=people=] do not know that they are members of a group, when they cannot easily find other
members of the group so as to advocate for their rights together, or when they cannot easily
understand why they are being categorised into a given group, their ability to protect themselves
through self-governing approaches to privacy is largely eliminated.

One common problem in group privacy is when the actions of one member of a group reveal information
that other members would prefer were not shared in this way (or at all). For instance, one person
may publish a picture of an event in which they are featured alongside others while the other people
captured in the same picture would prefer their participation not to be disclosed. Another example
of such issues are sites that enable people to upload their contacts: the person performing the
upload might be more open to disclosing their social networks than the people they are connected to
are. Such issues do not necessarily admit simple, straightforward solutions, but they need to be
carefully considered by people building websites.

### Transparency and Research {#transparency-for-research}

While transparency rarely helps enough to inform the individual choices that [=people=] may
make, it plays a critical role in letting researchers and reporters inform our
collective decision-making about privacy principles. This consideration extends the
TAG's resolution on a [Strong and Secure Web Platform](https://www.w3.org/blog/2015/11/strong-web-platform-statement/)
to ensure that "<i>broad testing and audit continues to be possible</i>" where
[=information flows=] and automated decisions are involved.

Such transparency can only function if there are strong rights of access to data (including data
derived from one's personal data) as well as mechanisms to explain the outcomes of automated
decisions.

## User Agents {#user-agents}

A [=user agent=] acts as an intermediary between a [=person=] (its [=user=]) and the web.
[=User agents=] implement, to the extent possible, the principles that collective governance
establishes in favour of individuals. They seek to prevent the creation of asymmetries of
information, and serve their [=user=] by providing them with automation to rectify
[=automation asymmetries=]. Where possible, they protect their [=user=] from receiving
intrusive messages.

The [=user agent=] is expected to align fully with the [=person=] using it and to operate exclusively
in that [=person=]'s interest. It is <em>not</em> the [=first party=]. The [=user agent=] serves the
[=person=] as a <dfn>trustworthy agent</dfn>:
it always puts that [=person=]'s interest first. In some occasions, this can mean protecting
that [=person=] from themselves by preventing them from carrying out a dangerous decision,
or by slowing down the person in their decision. For example, the
[=user agent=] will make it difficult for someone to connect to a site if it can't verify
that the site is authentic. It will check that that [=person=] really intends to expose a
sensitive device to a page. It will prevent that [=person=] from consenting to the permanent
monitoring of their behaviour. Its <dfn class="export">user agent duties</dfn> include
([[?Taking-Trust-Seriously]]):

<dl>
  <dt><dfn class="export">Duty of Protection</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
    Protection requires [=user agents=] to actively protect their [=user=]'s data, beyond
    simple security measures. It is insufficient to just encrypt at rest and in transit.
    The [=user agent=] must also limit retention, help ensure that only strictly
    necessary data is collected, and require guarantees from any [=actor=] that the user agent can
    reasonably be aware that data is shared to.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn class="export">Duty of Discretion</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
    Discretion requires the [=user agent=] to make best efforts to enforce
    principles by taking care in the ways it discloses the [=personal data=]
    that it manages. Discretion is not
    confidentiality or secrecy: trust
    can be preserved even when the [=user agent=] shares some [=personal data=], so long as
    it is done in an [=appropriately=] discreet manner.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn class="export">Duty of Honesty</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
    Honesty requires that the [=user agent=] give its [=user=]
    information of which the [=user agent=] can reasonably be aware, that is relevant to
    them and that will increase their
    autonomy, as long as they can understand it and there's an appropriate
    time to do so. This is almost never when the [=person=] is trying to do something else such as
    read a page or activate a feature. The duty of honesty goes well beyond that of
    transparency that is often included in older privacy regimes. Unlike transparency, honesty
    can't hide relevant information in complex legal notices and it can't rely on
    very short summaries provided in a consent dialog.
    If the person has provided [=consent=] to [=processing=] of their [=personal data=],
    the [=user agent=] should inform the [=person=] of ongoing [=processing=], with a
    level of obviousness that is proportional to the reasonably foreseeable impact of the processing.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn class="export">Duty of Loyalty</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
    Because the [=user agent=] is a [=trustworthy agent=], it is held to be loyal to the
    [=person=] using it in all situations, including in preference to the [=user agent=]'s implementer.
    When a [=user agent=] carries out [=processing=] that is detrimental to its [=user=]'s
    interests and instead benefits another [=actor=], this is <dfn data-lt="disloyalty">disloyal</dfn>. Often this would benefit the
    [=user agent=] itself, in which case it is known as "self-dealing". Behaviour can be [=disloyal=] even
    if it is done at the same time as [=processing=] that is in the [=person=]'s interest, what matters is
    that it potentially conflicts with that [=person=]'s interest. Additionally, it is important to keep in
    mind that additional [=processing=] almost always implies additional risk. Therefore [=processing=]
    that is not explicitly in a [=user=]'s interest is likely to be disloyal.
    [=Disloyalty=] is always [=inappropriate=].
  </dd>
</dl>

These duties ensure the [=user agent=] will <em>care</em> for its [=user=]. In academic
research, this relationship with a [=trustworthy agent=] is often described as "fiduciary"
([[?Fiduciary-Law]], [[?Fiduciary-Model]], [[?Taking-Trust-Seriously]];
see [[?Fiduciary-UA]] for a longer informal discussion). Some jurisdictions may have a distinct
legal meaning for "fiduciary." ([[?Fiduciary-Law]])

Many of the principles described in the rest of this document extend the [=user agent=]'s duties and
make them more precise.

## Incorporating Different Privacy Principles {#balancing}

While privacy principles are designed to work together and support each other,
occasionally a proposal to improve how a system follows one privacy principle may reduce
how well it follows another principle.

<div class="practice" data-audiences="websites user-agents api-designers">

<p><span class="practicelab" id="principle-pareto-frontier">When confronted with an
apparent tradeoff, first look for ways to improve all principles at once.</span></p>

Given any initial design that doesn't perfectly satisfy all principles, there are usually
some other designs that improve the situation for some principles without sacrificing
anything about the other principles. Work to find those designs.

Another way to say this is to look for [Pareto
improvements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency) before starting to trade
off between principles.

</div>

Once one is choosing between different designs at the Pareto frontier, the choice of which
privacy principles to prefer is complex and depends heavily on the details of each
particular situation. Note that people's privacy can also be in tension
with non-privacy concerns. As discussed in the [[[Ethical-Web]]], "it is important to
consider the context in which a particular technology is being applied, the expected
audience(s) for the technology, who the technology benefits and who it may disadvantage,
and any power dynamics involved" ([[Ethical-Web]]). Despite this complexity, there is a basic ground
rule to follow:

<div class="practice" data-audiences="websites user-agents">

<p><span class="practicelab" id="principle-limited-collection-for-safety">If a service
needs to collect extra data from its users in order to protect those or other users, it
must take extra technical and legal measures to ensure that this data can't be then used
for other purposes, like to grow the service.</span></p>

This is a special case of the <a href="#no-secondary-use">more general principle that data should not be used for more
purposes than those specified when the data was collected</a>.

Services sometimes use people's data in order to protect those or other people.
A service that does this should explain what data it's
using for this purpose. It should also say how it might use or share a person's
data if it believes that person has violated the service's rules.

</div>

<aside class="example" id="example-technical-legal-measures" title="Technical and Legal Measures">

A site might segregate the data it collects for safety reasons from its business data by:

1. Specifying in its privacy statement that these types of data are kept separate and
   implementing policies and procedures to ensure the data is stored separately. (Legal
   and procedural/compliance measures.)
1. Using multi-party computation to ensure that its business side can't learn the
   sensitive safety data unless both its safety side and a trusted independent third party
   collude. (A technical measure.)
1. Hiring a trusted auditor to publicly check that the data is effectively segregated. (A
   compliance measure.)

</aside>

It is attractive to say that if someone violates the rules of a service they're using,
then they sacrifice a proportionate amount of their privacy protections, but

1. Often the service can only prevent the rule violation by also collecting data from
   innocent users. This extra collection is not always [=appropriate=], especially if it
   allows pervasive monitoring ([[RFC7258]], [[RFC7687]]).
1. If a service operator wants to collect some extra data, it can be tempting for them to
   define rules and proportionality that allow them to do so.

The following examples illustrate some of the tensions:

<aside class="example" id="example-sockpuppets" title="Sockpuppets">

A person might want to sign up many accounts ("sockpuppets") or disguise the affiliation
of individual-owned accounts
("[astroturfing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing)") on a service in order to
trick other people into thinking a belief has more support than it really has. This
violates the other people's rights to be free from manipulation.

On the other hand, identifying everyone with enough detail to detect these cases tends to
violate their rights to be free from [=surveillance=] and [=correlation=].

</aside>

<aside class="example" id="example-children" title="Children's Services">

Children using a service (or their guardians) may want to ensure their interaction with
that service is only visible to other children. To accomplish this, the service would need
to check all of its users' ages.

While a service can ask its users to self-assert that they are under the specified age
(without verifying those assertions), or it might rely on trusted institutions (like
schools) to verify people's ages, to verify people's ages directly can be
privacy-invasive. It can require automated facial recognition, collection of live images,
or strongly identifying the children (e.g. via [[NIST-800-63A]]).

</aside>

<aside class="example" id="example-account-security" title="Account Security">

Accounts with a service need to be protected more strongly than just with a username and
password. Since a compromised account reveals all the private information stored in the
account, this is a privacy issue and not just a security issue. Services often store the
historical locations and machine characteristics that have accessed an account, in order
to make it harder to log in from an unusual place or type of machine. They might also
store other personal data, like a phone number or address, in order to check that a
suspicious login actually comes from the real account owner.

</aside>

<aside class="example" id="example-preventing-profiling" title="Preventing Profiling">

Some actors on the web place a high value on building a detailed profile of each user's
behavior, across websites. User agents are trying to enforce the principles in
[[[#identity]]] by blocking this profiling, but because the profiles are valuable, there's
a large incentive to work around user agent measures, sometimes by using techniques that
are very expensive or impossible to block. If user agent behavior causes websites to adopt
these alternate tracking methods, the web as a whole won't respect the [[[#identity]]]
principles.

User agents can reduce the incentive to develop these alternate tracking methods by
building APIs to facilitate the most common and least harmful uses of user profiles.
However, those APIs usually still reveal some information about a user's behavior. For
example, even the most privacy-respecting conversion attribution API will reveal a limited
amount of information about each user in order to replace the use of profiles to measure
the success of advertising campaigns. Even this small amount of information is still
[=personal data=].

</aside>

# Principles for Privacy on the Web

This section describes a set of principles designed to apply to the web
[=context=] in general. Specific [=contexts=] on the web may need more
constraints or other considerations. In time, we expect to see more specialized
privacy principles published, for more specific [=contexts=] on the web.

These principles should be enforced by [=user agents=]. When this is not possible,
additional enforcement mechanisms are needed.

## Identity on the Web {#identity}

<div class="practice" data-audiences="user-agents">

<span class="practicelab" id="principle-identity-per-context">A [=user agent=]
should help its user present the [=identity=] they want in each [=context=]
they are in, and should prevent or support [=recognition=] as appropriate.
</span>

</div>

A [=person=]'s <dfn>identity</dfn> is the set of characteristics that define
them. Their identity *in a [=context=]* is the set of characteristics they
present under particular circumstances.

People can present different identities to different contexts, and can
also share a single identity across several different contexts.

People may wish to present an ephemeral or anonymous identity. This is
a set of characteristics that is too small or unstable to be useful
for following them through time.

A person's [=identities=] may often be distinct from whatever legal identity
or identities they hold.

In some circumstances, the best way for a [=user agent=] to uphold this
principle is to prevent [=recognition=] (e.g. so that one [=site=] can't
learn anything about its [=user=]'s behavior on *another* site).

In other circumstances, the best way for a [=user agent=] to uphold this
principle is to *support* [=recognition=] (e.g. to help its [=user=] prove
to one [=site=] that they have a particular identity on another [=site=]).

Similarly, a [=user agent=] can help its [=user=] by preventing or supporting
[=recognition=] across *repeat* visits to the *same* [=site=].

[=User agents=] should do their best to distinguish [=contexts=] within a site
and adjust their [=partitions=] to prevent or support [=recognition=] across those intra-site [=contexts=]
according to their [=users=]' wishes.

## Data Minimization {#data-minimization}

<div class="practice" data-audiences="websites user-agents"><span class="practicelab">[=Sites=], [=user agents=], and other [=actors=]
should restrict the [=data=] they transfer to what's either necessary to achieve their users'
goals or aligns with their users' wishes and interests.</span></div>

<div class="practice" data-audiences="api-designers"><span class="practicelab">Web APIs should be designed to minimize the amount of data that sites need
to request to carry out their users' goals.
Web APIs should also provide granularity and user controls over <a>personal
data</a> that is communicated to [=sites=].</span></div>

Data minimization limits the risks of data being disclosed or misused. It also
helps [=user agents=] and other [=actors=] more meaningfully explain the decisions their users need
to make. For more information, see [[[Data-Minimization]]].

The principle of data minimization applies to all [=personal data=], even if it
is not known to be identifying, sensitive, or otherwise harmful. See:
[[[#hl-sensitive-information]]].

<aside class="example" id="example-per-site-email">

A simple `<input type="email">` element tends to provide two pieces of data.
First, that its user can receive messages sent to that email address, but also
that this is one of only a few email addresses associated with the user. The
second piece of data makes the address useful for [=recognize|recognizing=]
people across contexts. One way to remove that second piece of data, minimizing
the data exposed, is to autogenerate a new email address for each context.

</aside>

### Ancillary uses

[=Sites=] sometimes use data in ways that aren't needed for the user's immediate
goals. For example, they might bill advertisers, measure site performance, or
tell developers about bugs. These uses are known as <dfn data-lt="ancillary
use">ancillary uses</dfn>.

[=Sites=] can get the data they want for [=ancillary uses=] from a variety of places:

<dl>
  <dt><dfn>Non-ancillary APIs</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
    Web APIs that were designed to support users' immediate goals, like <a
    data-cite="dom#interface-event">DOM events</a> and <a
    data-cite="cssom-view-1#extension-to-the-element-interface">element position
    observers</a>.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn>Ancillary APIs computed from existing information</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
    APIs that filter, summarize, or time-shift information available from
    [=non-ancillary APIs=], like the [[[event-timing]]] and <a
    data-cite="intersection-observer#introduction">IntersectionObserver</a>. See
    [[[#information]]] for restrictions on how existing non-ancillary APIs can
    be used to justify new ancillary APIs.
  </dd>

  <dt><dfn>Ancillary APIs that provide new information</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
    APIs that provide new information that's primarily useful to support the
    ancillary uses, like <a data-cite="element-timing#sec-intro">element paint
    timing</a>, <a data-cite="performance-measure-memory#intro">memory usage
    measurements</a>, and <a
    data-cite="deprecation-reporting#deprecation-report">deprecation
    reports</a>.
  </dd>
</dl>

All of these sources of data can reveal [=personal data=] about a person's
configuration, device, environment, or behavior that could be <a
href="#hl-sensitive-information">sensitive</a> or be used as part of <a>browser
fingerprinting</a> to <a data-lt="cross-context recognition">recognize people
across contexts</a>. In order to uphold the principle of [[[#data-minimization]]], [=sites=] and
[=user agents=] should seek to understand and respect people's goals and preferences about
use of this data.

The task force does not have consensus about how [=user agents=] should handle
[=ancillary APIs computed from existing information=].
Advocates of these APIs argue that they're hard to use to
extract [=personal data=], they're more efficient than collecting the same
information though [=non-ancillary APIs=], sites are less likely to adopt these
APIs if a significant number of people turn them off, and that the act of
turning them off can contribute to [=browser fingerprinting=].
Opponents argue that if data's easier or cheaper to collect, more sites will
collect it, and because there's still some risk, users should be able
to turn off this group of APIs that probably won't directly break a site's
functionality.

Because different users are likely to have different preferences:

<div class="practice" data-audiences="api-designers">
<span class="practicelab" id="principle-identify-ancillary-apis">Specifications
for [=ancillary APIs computed from existing information=] and [=ancillary APIs
that provide new information=] should identify them as such, so that [=user
agents=] can provide appropriate choices for their users.</span>
</div>

#### Designing ancillary APIs that provide new information {#designing-ancillary-apis-with-new-information}

<div class="practice" data-audiences="api-designers">
<span class="practicelab"
id="principle-ancillary-apis-with-new-information-shouldnt-reveal-personal-data">
[=Ancillary APIs that provide new information=] should not reveal any [=personal
data=] that isn't already available through other APIs, without an indication
that doing so aligns with the user's wishes and interests.
</span>
</div>

Most [=ancillary uses=] don't require that a site learn any [=personal data=].
For example, site performance measurements and ad billing involve averaging or
summing data across many users such that any individual's contribution is
obscured. Private aggregation techniques can often allow an API to serve its use
case without exposing [=personal data=], by preventing any of the people
involved from being identifiable.

<aside class="note">
  There is ongoing work on this sort of private aggregation in the
  <abbr title="Internet Engineering Task
  Force">IETF</abbr> <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/ppm/about/"><abbr
  title="privacy-preserving measurement">ppm</abbr></a>, <abbr title="Internet Research Task
  Force">IRTF</abbr> <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/rg/pearg/about/"><abbr title="Privacy
  Enhancements and Assessments Research Group">pearg</abbr></a>, and W3C <a
  href="https://patcg.github.io/"><abbr title="Private Advertising Technology Community
  Group">PATCG</abbr></a> groups.
</aside>

Some [=ancillary uses=] don't require their data to be related to a person, but
the useful aggregations across many people are difficult to design into a web
API, or they might require new technologies to be invented. API designers have a
few choices in this situation:

* Sometimes an API can [=de-identify=] the data instead, but this is difficult
  if a web page has any input into the data that's collected.
* API designers can check carefully that the API doesn't reveal _new_ [=personal
  data=], as described by [[[#information]]]. For example, the API might reveal
  that a person has a fast graphics card, that they click slowly, or that they
  use a certain proxy, but the fact that they click slowly is already
  <a href="#unavoidable-information-exposure">unavoidably</a> revealed
  by <a data-cite="dom#interface-event">DOM event</a> timing.
* [=User agents=] can ask their users' permission to enable this class of API.
  To reduce [=privacy labor=], a [=user agent=] could use a first-run dialog to
  ask the user whether they generally support sharing this data, rather than
  asking for each use of the APIs.

If an API had to make one of these choices, and then something else about the
API needs to change, designers should consider replacing the whole API with one
that avoids exposing [=personal data=].

Some other [=ancillary uses=] do require that a person be connected to their
data. For example, a person might want to file a bug report that a website
breaks on their particular computer, and be able to get follow-up communication
from the developers while they fix the bug. This is an appropriate time to ask
the person's permission.

<div class="practice" data-audiences="user-agents">
<span class="practicelab" id="principle-disabling-ancillary-apis-with-new-information">
User agents should provide a way to enable or disable [=ancillary APIs that
provide new information=] and should set the default according to their users'
needs.
</span>
</div>

Some people might know something about their
specific situation that makes the API designers' general decisions inappropriate
for them. Because the information provided by [=ancillary APIs that provide new
information=] isn't
available in any other way, [=user agents=] should let people turn them off,
despite the additional risk of [=browser fingerprinting=].

## Information access {#information}

<div class="practice" data-audiences="api-designers user-agents">
  <span class="practicelab">New web APIs should guard users' information at least
  as well as existing APIs that are expected to stay in the web platform.</span>
</div>

The many APIs available to websites expose lots of data that can be combined
into information about people, web servers, and other things.

User-controlled settings or permissions can <dfn data-lt="access guard">guard
access</dfn> to data on the web. When designing a web API, use [=access guards=]
to ensure the API exposes information in [=appropriate=] ways.

<aside class="example">
  For example, the URLs of resources, the timing of link clicks, and the referrer chain within a
  single origin are not guarded by anything; the scroll position is guarded by the setting to turn off
  JavaScript; and access to the camera or geolocation are guarded by permission prompts.

  When the `<img loading=lazy>` attribute was added, the designers realized
  that it exposed the scroll position, so it's also guarded by the setting to turn
  off JavaScript.
</aside>

New APIs which add new ways of getting information must be
[=access guards|guarded=] at least as strongly as the existing ways.

Information that would be acceptable to expose under one set of [=access guards=] might be
unacceptable under another set. When an API designer intends to explain that their new
API is acceptable because an existing acceptable API already exposes the same information,
they must be careful to ensure that their new API is only available under a set of guards
that are at least as strict. Without those guards, they need to make the argument from
scratch, without relying on the existing API.

If existing APIs provide access to some information, but there is a plan to
change those APIs to prevent that access, new APIs must not be added that
provide that same information, unless they include additional
[=access guards=] that ensure access is [=appropriate=].

For example, browsers are gradually removing the ability to join identities
between different [=partitions=]. It is important that new APIs do not add
features which re-enable [=cross-context recognition=].

### Unavoidable information exposure {#unavoidable-information-exposure}

Some functionality of the web has historically been provided using features
that can be used to undermine people's privacy. It
is not yet possible to remove access to all of the information that it would be
better not to expose.

<aside class="example">
  Some users are disappointed that the page they're visiting can discover which link
  they clicked to leave that page. We can't block that information
  because the page can use <a data-cite="RFC9110#status.3xx">HTTP redirects</a> to
  learn it, and redirection is a core feature of the web.

  Some users are disappointed that a page with permission to run JavaScript can record
  their pattern of interaction with that page. However, the page does this by using
  the same events it would use to make the page interactive, so we can't block this
  information access either.
</aside>

New APIs that unavoidably provide access to this kind of information should
not make that information easier to access compared to existing comparable
web platform features.

Specifications describing these APIs should also:

* make it clear how to remove this access in the event that future web
  platform changes make it possible to remove other access to the same
  information.
* make it clear how any [=user agent=] which blocks access to this kind of
  information (perhaps by breaking some experiences on the web that
  other browsers don't wish to break) can prevent the new API from exposing that
  information without breaking additional sites or user experiences.

<aside class="example">
  Usually, these APIs will be designed to expose data that enables some
  [=appropriate=] information discovery, as recommended by [[[web-without-3p-cookies]]]:

  > It is better to approach [these use cases] with replacement technologies
  that are designed-for-purpose and built to respect user privacy.

  For example, they might reveal a performance metric for a website directly
  instead of requiring it to be computed from the timing of
  {{GlobalEventHandlers/onload}} events.

  When designing an API like this, aim to ensure that the data it exposes
  doesn't make it cheaper to compute information about people than it would
  have been through other methods.

  > It is better to approach [these use cases] with replacement technologies
  that are designed-for-purpose and built to respect user privacy.

Many pieces of information about someone could cause privacy harms if disclosed.
For example:

* Their location.
* Language preferences.
* Any [=identifiers=] associated with them.
* Video or audio from their camera or microphone.
* The content of certain files on their filesystem.
* Financial data.
* Contacts.
* Calendar entries.
* [Whether they are using assistive technology.](https://w3ctag.github.io/design-principles/#do-not-expose-use-of-assistive-tech)

A particular piece of information may have different sensitivity for different
people. People can become vulnerable if sensitive information about them is,
or is likely to be, exposed; see [[[#vulnerability]]].

<aside class="example">
Precise location information can be extremely sensitive because it's
identifying, because it allows for in-person intrusions, because it can reveal
detailed information about a person's life; but it might also be public and not
sensitive at all, or it might be low-enough granularity that it is less
sensitive for many people. Beware that reducing granularity of location
information might not hide precise location information from an [=actor=],
particularly if location information is repeatedly requested over time or if the
[=actor=] has other relevant information about the [=person=] [<a
data-cite="RFC6772#section-13.5">RFC6772</a>].
</aside>

When considering whether a class of information is likely to be sensitive to
a person, consider at least these factors:

* whether it serves as a persistent [=identifier=] (see
  [severity](https://www.w3.org/TR/fingerprinting-guidance/#identifying-fingerprinting-surface-and-evaluating-severity) in
  [[[fingerprinting-guidance]]]);
* whether it discloses substantial (including intimate details or inferences)
  information about the person using the system or other people;
* whether it can be used to infer particular characteristics that put the person at risk of greater harm;
* whether it enables other threats, like intrusion.


## Data Rights {#data-rights}

<div class="practice" data-audiences="websites user-agents api-designers">
  <span class="practicelab" id="respect-data-rights">
    [=People=] have certain rights over [=data=] that is about themselves, and these rights should
    be facilitated by their [=user agent=] and the [=actors=] that are [=processing=] their
    [=data=].
  </span>
</div>

While data rights alone are not sufficient to satisfy all [=privacy=] principles for the web, they
do support self-determination and help improve accountability. Such rights include:

* The <dfn data-export="">right to access</dfn> [=data=] about oneself.

This right includes both being able to review what information has been collected or inferred about
oneself and being able to discover what [=actors=] have collected information about oneself. As a
result, databases containing information about [=people=] cannot be kept secret, and data collected about people needs to be meaningfully
discoverable by those people.

* The <dfn data-export="" data-lt="right to erase">right to erase</dfn> [=data=] about oneself.

A [=person=] has a right to erase information about themselves whether or not they are terminating use of a service altogether, though what
[=data=] can be erased may differ between those two cases. On the web, a [=person=] may wish to erase
data on their device, on a server, or both, and the data's location may not always be clear to the person.

* The <dfn data-export="" data-lt="right to portability" data-local-lt="portability">right to
port</dfn> [=data=], including data one has stored with another [=actor=], so it can easily be reused or
transferred elsewhere.

Portability is needed to support a [=person=]'s ability to make choices about services with
different data practices. Standards for interoperability are essential for effective re-use.

* The <dfn data-export="">right to correct</dfn> [=data=] about oneself, to ensure that one's
[=identity=] is properly reflected in a system.

* The <dfn data-export="">right to be free from automated decision-making</dfn> based on [=data=]
about oneself.

For some kinds of decision-making with substantial consequences, there is a privacy interest in
being able to exclude oneself from automated profiling. For example, some services may alter the
price of products (price discrimination) or offers for credit or insurance based on [=data=]
collected about a person. Those alterations may be consequential (financially, say) and
objectionable to people who believe those decisions based on data about them are inaccurate or
unjust. As another example, some services may draw inferences about a user's identity, humanity, or
presence based on facial recognition algorithms run on camera data. Because facial recognition
algorithms and training sets are fallible and may exhibit certain biases, people may not wish to
submit to decisions based on that kind of automated recognition.

* The <dfn data-export=""
  data-lt="right to object|right to withdraw consent|right to restrict use">right to object,
withdraw consent, and restrict use</dfn> of data about oneself.

[=People=] may change their decisions about [=consent=] or may object to subsequent uses of data about
themselves. Data rights mean that a person needs to have ongoing control, not just a choice at the time of collection.

The OECD Privacy Principles [[OECD-Guidelines]], [[Records-Computers-Rights]], and the [[GDPR]],
among other places, describe many of the rights [=people=] have as data subjects. These participatory
rights by people over data about themselves are inherent to [=autonomy=].

## De-identified Data {#deidentified-data}

<div class="practice" data-audiences="websites">

<p>
  <span class="practicelab" id="de-identify-data">
    Whenever possible, processors should work with [=data=] that has been [=de-identified=].
  </span>
</p>

</div>

Data is <dfn data-lt="de-identify|de-identification">de-identified</dfn> when there exists a high level of confidence
that no [=person=] described by the data can be identified, directly or indirectly
(e.g. via association with an [=identifier=], user agent, or device), by that data alone or in
combination with other available information. Note
that further considerations relating to groups are covered in the
<a href="#collective">Collective Issues in Privacy</a> section.

We talk of <dfn>controlled de-identified data</dfn> when:
1. The _state_ of the data is such that the information that could be used to re-identify an
   individual has been removed or altered, and
2. there is a _process_ in place to prevent attempts to re-identify [=people=] and the inadvertent
   release of the de-identified data. ([[?De-identification-Privacy-Act]])

Different situations involving [=controlled de-identified data=] will require different controls.
For instance, if the [=controlled de-identified data=] is <em>only</em> being processed by one
[=actor=], typical controls include making sure that the [=identifiers=] used in the data are unique
to that dataset, that any person (e.g. an employee of the [=actor=]) with access to the [=data=] is
barred (e.g. based on legal terms) from sharing the [=data=] further, and that technical measures
exist to prevent re-identification or the joining of different data sets involving this [=data=].

In general, the goal is to ensure that [=controlled de-identified data=] is used in a manner that
provides a viable degree of oversight and accountability such that technical and procedural means to
guarantee the maintenance of pseudonymity are preserved.

This is more difficult when the [=controlled de-identified data=] is shared between several
[=actors=]. In such cases, good examples of typical controls that are representative of best
practices would include making sure that:

* the [=identifiers=] used in the [=data=] are under the direct and exclusive control of the [=first
  party=] (the [=actor=] a person is directly interacting with) who is prevented by strict controls
  from matching the identifiers with the data;

* when these [=identifiers=] are shared with a [=third party=], they are made unique
  to that [=third party=] such that if they are shared with more than one
  [=third party=] these cannot then match them up with one another;

* there is a strong level of confidence that no [=third party=] can match the [=data=]
  with any data other than that obtained through interactions with the [=first
  party=];

* any [=third party=] receiving such [=data=] is barred (e.g. based on legal terms)
  from sharing it further;

* technical measures exist to prevent re-identification or the joining of
  different data sets involving this [=data=]; and

* there exist contractual terms between the [=first party=] and [=third party=]
  describing the limited [=purpose=] for which the data is being shared.

Note that [=controlled de-identified data=], on its own, is not sufficient to make
[=data processing=] [=appropriate=].

## Collective Privacy {#collective-privacy}

<div class="practice" data-audiences="websites user-agents">

<p>
  <span class="practicelab" id="principle-collective-privacy">
    Groups and institutions should support autonomy by making
    decisions collectively to either prevent or enable data
    sharing, and to set defaults for data processing rules.
  </span>
</p>

</div>

Privacy principles are often defined in terms of extending rights to individuals. However, there are
cases in which deciding which principles apply is best done collectively, on behalf of a group.
Collective decision-making should be considered:

<ul>
  <li>
    When information is about membership in a group or about a group's behaviour.
    As Brent Mittelstadt explains, “<em>Algorithmically grouped
    individuals have a collective interest in the creation of information about the group, and actions
    taken on its behalf.</em>” ([[?Individual-Group-Privacy]])
    As <a href="#group-privacy"></a> discusses,
    an individual's permission isn't enough to support the [=autonomy=] of other members of the group.
  </li>

  <li>
    When individuals can't realistically be expected to make informed decisions.
    This can happen when [=data processing=] is complex
    or requests to process data happen very frequently.
  </li>

  <li>
    When individuals have systematically less power
    than the organizations asking them to agree to [=data processing=] ([[?Relational-Turn]]).
  </li>

  <li>
    When the [=data processing=] is unjust at a societal level even if an individual remains anonymous ([[?Relational-Governance]]).
  </li>
</ul>

Different forms of collective decision-making are legitimate depending on what data is being processed.
These forms might be governmental bodies at various administrative levels, standards
organisations, worker bargaining units, or civil society fora.
Even though collective decision-making can be better than offloading
[=privacy labour=] to [=individuals=], it is not a panacea.
Decision-making bodies need to be designed carefully,
for example using the <a data-cite="IAD#">Institutional Analysis and Development framework</a>.

## Device Owners and Administrators {#device-administrators}

<div class="practice" data-audiences="user-agents">
<span class="practicelab" id="principle-owned-devices-disclose-surveillance">
[=User agents=] should not tell an [=administrator=] about user behavior except
when that disclosure is necessary to enforce reasonable constraints on use of
the device or software.
Even when a disclosure is reasonable, [=user agents=] must ensure their users
know about this surveillance.
</span>
</div>
<div class="note">
See [[[#guardians]]] for more detail on how this principle applies to vulnerable people with [=guardians=].
</div>

Computing devices have <dfn data-lt="administrator">administrators</dfn>, who
have privileged access to the devices in order to install and configure the
programs that run on them. The <dfn data-lt="device owner">owner</dfn> of a
device can authorize an [=administrator=] to administer the whole device.
Some [=user agent=] [=implementations=] can also assign an [=administrator=] to
manage a particular [=user agent=] based on the account that's logged into it.

Sometimes the [=person=] using a device doesn't own the device or have
[=administrator=] access to it (e.g. an employer providing a device to an
employee; a friend loaning a device to their guest; or a parent providing a
device to their young child). Other times, the owner and primary user of a
device might not be the only person with [=administrator=] access.

These relationships can involve power imbalances. A child may have difficulty accessing any
computing devices other than the ones their parent provides. A victim of [=abuse=] might not be able to
prevent their partner from having [=administrator=] access to their devices. An employee might have
to agree to use their employer's devices in order to keep their job.

While a [=device owner=] has an interest and sometimes a responsibility to make sure their device is
used in the ways they intended, the [=person=] _using_ the device still has a right to privacy while
using it. This principle enforces this right to privacy in two ways:

1. [=User agent=] developers need to consider whether requests from [=device owners=] and
   [=administrators=] are reasonable, and refuse to implement unreasonable requests, even if that
   means fewer sales. Owner/administrator needs do not supersede user needs in the <a
   data-cite="design-principles#priority-of-constituencies">priority of constituencies</a>.
1. Even when information disclosure is reasonable, the [=person=] whose data is being disclosed
   needs to know about it so that they can avoid doing things that would lead to unwanted
   consequences.

Some [=administrator=] requests might be reasonable for some sorts of users, like employees or
children, but not be reasonable for other sorts, like friends or intimate partners.
The [=user agent=] should explain what the [=administrator=] is going to learn in a way that
helps different users to react appropriately.


## Protecting web users from abusive behaviour

<div class="practice" data-audiences="websites api-designers">
  <p>
    <span class="practicelab" id="abuse-reporting">
      Systems that allow for communicating on the web must provide an
      effective capability to report [=abuse=].
    </span>
  </p>
</div>
<div class="practice" data-audiences="websites user-agents api-designers">
  <p>
    <span class="practicelab" id="abuse-protection">
      [=User agents=] and [=sites=] must
      take steps to protect their users from abusive behaviour, and [=abuse=]
      mitigation must be considered when designing web platform features.
    </span>
  </p>
</div>

Digital <dfn>abuse</dfn> is the mistreatment of a person through digital means. Online <dfn>harassment</dfn>
is the "pervasive or severe targeting of an individual or group online through harmful behavior" [[PEN-Harassment]]
and constitutes a form of [=abuse=]. Harassment is a prevalent problem on the web,
particularly via social media. While harassment may affect any person using the web, it may be more
severe and its consequences more impactful for LGBTQ people, women, people in racial or ethnic
minorities, people with disabilities, [=vulnerable people=] and other marginalized groups.

[=Harassment=] is both a violation of privacy itself and can be enabled or
exacerbated by other violations of privacy.

Harassment may include: sending [=unwanted information=]; directing others to contact
or bother a person ("dogpiling"); disclosing [sensitive information](#sensitive-information) about a person; posting false information about a person; impersonating a person; insults; threats; and hateful or demeaning speech.

Disclosure of identifying or contact information (including "doxxing") can often be used to cause additional attackers to send persistent [=unwanted information=] that amounts to harassment.
Disclosure of location information can be used to intrude on a
person's physical safety or space.

Reporting mechanisms are mitigations, but may not prevent harassment, particularly in cases where
hosts, moderators, or other intermediaries are supportive of or complicit in the [=abuse=].

Effective reporting is likely to require:

* standardized mechanisms to identify [=abuse=] reporting contacts;
* sites and user agents to provide visible and usable ways to report [=abuse=];
* identifiers to refer to senders and content;
* the ability to provide context and explanation of harms;
* people responsible for promptly responding to reports;
* tools for pooling mitigation information (see [[[#example-reducing-unwanted-information]]]).

<aside class="note">
  Some useful research overviews of online harassment include: [[?PEW-Harassment]],
  [[?Addressing-Cyber-Harassment]] and [[?Internet-of-Garbage]].
</aside>

<dfn>Unwanted information</dfn> covers a broad range of unsolicited communication, from messages
that are typically harmless individually but that become a nuisance in aggregate (spam) to the
sending of explicit, graphic, or violent images.

System designers should take steps to make the sending of unwanted information more difficult
or more costly, and to make the senders more accountable.


<aside class="example" id="example-reducing-unwanted-information">
Examples of mitigations include:

* Restricting what new users of a service can post, e.g. limiting links and media until a user has
  interacted a sufficient number of times over a given period with a larger group. This helps to
  raise the cost of producing [sock puppet accounts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sock_puppet_account) and gives new users time to understand local norms before posting.
* Only accepting communication between [=people=] who have an established relationship of some kind,
  such as being part of a shared group. Protocols should consider requiring a handshake between
  [=people=] prior to enabling communication.
* Requiring a deliberate action from the recipient before rendering media coming from an
  untrusted source.
* Supporting the ability for [=people=] to block another [=actor=] such that they cannot send information
  again.
* Pooling mitigation information, for instance shared block lists, shared spam-detection
  information, or public information about misbehaving [=actors=].
* Enabling users to filter out or hide information or media based on tags or content warnings.
</aside>

## Purpose limitation

<div class="practice" data-audiences="websites user-agents">
  <span class="practicelab" id="purpose-specification">
    When accessing personal data or requesting permission, [=sites=] and other [=actors=] should specify the [=purpose=]
    for which the data will be used.
  </span>
</div>

<div class="practice" data-audiences="websites user-agents">
  <span class="practicelab" id="no-secondary-use">
    [=Actors=] should not use personal data for purposes other than those specified. (Other uses are often called
    [=secondary uses=].)
  </span>
</div>

Features that are designed-for-purpose facilitate these principles by providing functionality that is only or primarily
useful for a particular purpose. Designed-for-purpose features make it easier to explain the purpose to people, and may
also limit the feasible secondary uses of data.

[=Controlled de-identified data=] may be used for additional purposes in ways that are compatible with the specified
purpose.

## Transparency {#transparency}

<div class="practice" data-audiences="websites user-agents">
  <span class="practicelab" id="transparency-when-requested">
    When accessing data or requesting permission, [=sites=] (and other [=actors=]) should provide
    [=people=] with relevant explanatory information about the use of data, and [=user agents=]
    should help present and consume that information.
  </span>
</div>

Transparency is a necessary, but insufficient, condition for [=consent=]. Relevant explanatory
information includes who is accessing data, what data is accessed (including the potential
inferences or combinations of such data) and how data is used. For transparency to be meaningful to
people, explanatory information must be provided in the relevant [=context=].

<div class="note">
  In designing new web features that may involve permissions, consider whether a permission is
  needed and how to make that permission meaningful [[?ADDING-PERMISSIONS]].

  Past workshops have explored the needs for better permissions on the web:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/Privacy/permissions-ws-2022/report">2022 W3C Workshop on
    Permissions</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/Privacy/permissions-ws-2018/report.html">2018 W3C Workshop on
    Permissions and User Consent</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/2014/07/permissions/minutes.html">2014 Next steps on trust and
    permissions for web applications</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="practice" data-audiences="websites api-designers">
  <span class="practicelab" id="transparency-plain-language-machine-readable">
    Information about privacy-relevant practices should be provided in both easily accessible plain
    language form and in machine-readable form.
  </span>
</div>

Machine-readable presentation of privacy-relevant practices is necessary for [=user agents=] to be
able to help [=people=] make general decisions, rather than relying falsely on the idea that
[=people=] can or want to read documentation before every visit to a web site. Machine-readable
presentation also facilitates <a href="#collective">collective governance</a> by making it more
feasible for researchers and regulators to discover, document, and analyze data collection and
processing to identify cases in which it may be harmful.

Easily accessible, plain language presentation of privacy-relevant practices is necessary for
[=people=] to be able to make informed decisions in specific cases when they choose to do so.
[=Sites=], [=user agents=], and other [=actors=] all may need to present privacy-relevant practices
to [=people=] in accessible forms.

<div class="practice" data-audiences="websites api-designers">
  <span class="practicelab" id="transparency-distinguishable">
    Mechanisms that can be used for [=recognize|recognizing=] [=people=] should be designed so that
    their operation is visible and distinguishable, to [=user agents=], researchers, and regulators.
  </span>
</div>

Non-transparent methods of [=recognition=] are harmful in part because they are not visible to the
user, which undermines user control [[?UNSANCTIONED-TRACKING]]. Designing features that minimize
data and make requests for data explicit can enable detectability, a kind of transparency that is an
important mitigation for <a>browser fingerprinting</a>.

## Consent, Withdrawal of Consent, Opt-Outs, and Objections {#consent-principles}

<div class="practice" data-audiences="websites">
<p>
  <span class="practicelab" id="principle-consent-user-preference">
    When any [=actor=] obtains [=consent=] for processing from a [=person=], the
    actor should design the consent request so as to learn the person's true
    intent to consent or not, and not to maximize the processing consented to.
  </span>
</p>
</div>

Attempts to obtain consent to [=processing=] that is not in accordance with the person's
true preferences result in imposing unwanted [=privacy labour=] on the person, and may
result in people erroneously giving consent that they regret later.

An [=actor=] should not prompt a [=person=] for consent if the
person is unlikely to have sufficient information to make an informed decision to consent or not.
In considering whether or not a person is sufficiently informed to be asked for consent,
actors should be realistic in assessing how much time and effort would be required to understand the
processing for which they are asking for consent.
Simply providing a link to a complex policy is unlikely to mean that the person is informed.

<div class="practice" data-audiences="websites">
<p>
  <span class="practicelab" id="principle-minimize-consent-requests">
    An [=actor=] should avoid interrupting a [=person=]'s use of a site for
	  consent requests when an alternative is available.
  </span>
</p>
</div>

Examples of alternatives to interrupting users with consent requests include:

 * Considering the information sharing norms in the site's audience
   and category, and requesting only consent that is appropriate
   to the purpose of the site. (For example, a photo sharing site's
   users might expect to be prompted for consent to share their
   uploaded work.)  Sites should consider conducting user research on
   people's expectations for how data is processed.

 * Relying on a [=global opt-out=] signal from the [=user agent=].

 * Delaying a prompt for consent until a [=user=] does something that puts the request in context,
    which will also help them give an informed response.

<div class="practice" data-audiences="websites">
<p>
  <span class="practicelab" id="principle-consent-withdraw">
    It should be as easy for a [=person=] to check what consent they have given, to withdraw consent,
    or to opt out or object, as to give consent.
  </span>
</p>
</div>

A [=person=] may share data about other [=people=] (e.g. a picture with both that person and others). If that person consents to the processing of that data, this does not imply that those other people have consented as well.

<div class="practice" data-audiences="websites">
  <p>
    <span class="practicelab" id="principle-consent-otherpeople">
      [=Actors=] should provide functionality to access, correct, and remove data about

## Notifications and Interruptions {#interruptions}

Notifications and other interruptive UI can be a powerful way to capture attention.
Depending on the operating system in use, a notification can appear outside of the
browser context (for example, in a general notifications tray) or even cause a device to
buzz or play an alert tone.
Like all powerful features, notifications can be misused and can become an annoyance
or even used to manipulate behaviour and thus reduce [=autonomy=].

<div class="practice" data-audiences="user-agents">

  <span class="practicelab" id="principle-notifications-control">A [=user agent=] should help
    users control notifications and other interruptive UI that can be used to manipulate behavior.</span>

  [=User agents=] should provide UI that allows their users to audit which web [=sites=] have been granted
  permission to display alerts and to revoke these permissions.
  [=User agents=] should also apply some quality metric to the initial request for permissions to receive
  notifications (for example, disallowing sites from requesting permission on first visit).

</div>
<div class="practice" data-audiences="websites">

  <span class="practicelab" id="principle-notifications-context">Web [=sites=] should use notifications
    only for information that their users have specifically requested.
  </span>

  Web [=sites=] should tell their users what specific kind of information people can expect to
  receive, and how notifications can be turned off,  when requesting permission to send interruptive
  notifications.  Web [=sites=] should not request permission to send notifications when
  the user is unlikely to have sufficient knowledge (e.g. information about what kinds of
  notifications they are signing up for) to make an informed response. If it's unlikely
  that such information could have been provided then the [=user agent=] should apply
  mitigations (for example, warning about potential malicious use of the notifications
  API).
  Permissions should be requested in context.

</div>

## Non-Retaliation {#non-retaliation}

<div class="practice" data-audiences="websites">
  <span class="practicelab" id="principle-do-not-retaliate">
    [=Actors=] must not retaliate against [=people=] who protect their [=data=] against
    non-essential [=processing=] or exercise rights over their [=data=].
  </span>
</div>

Whenever people have the ability to cause an [=actor=] to process less of their [=data=] or to stop
carrying out some given set of data processing that is not essential to the service, they must be
allowed to do so without the [=actor=] retaliating, for instance by artificially removing an
unrelated feature, by decreasing the quality of the service, or by trying to cajole, badger, or
trick the [=person=] into opting back into the [=processing=].

## Support Choosing Which Information to Present {#support-choosing-info}

<div class="practice" data-audiences="user-agents">
  <span class="practicelab" id="principle-support-choosing-info">
    [=User agents=] should support [=people=] in choosing which information they provide to [=actors=] that
    request it, up to and including allowing users to provide arbitrary information.
  </span>
</div>

[=Actors=] can invest time and energy into automating ways of gathering [=data=] from [=people=] and can
design their products in ways that make it a lot easier for [=people=] to disclose information than not, whereas
[=people=] typically have to manually wade through options, repeated prompts, and [=deceptive patterns=]. In many
cases, the absence of data — when a [=person=] refuses to provide some information — can also be identifying
or revealing. Additionally, APIs can be defined or implemented in rigid ways that can prevent people from
accessing useful functionality. For example, I might want to look for restaurants in a city I will be visiting
this weekend, but if my geolocation is forcefully set to match my GPS, a restaurant-finding
site might only allow searches in my current location. In other cases, sites do not abide by data
minimisation principles and request more information than they require. This principle supports
[=people=] in minimising their own data.

[=User agents=] should make it simple for [=people=] to [present the identity they wish
to](#principle-identity-per-context) and to provide information about themselves or their devices in
ways that they control. This helps [=people=] to live in obscurity ([[?Lost-In-Crowd]],
[[?Obscurity-By-Design]]), including by obfuscating information about themselves ([[?Obfuscation]]).

<div class="practice" data-audiences="api-designers">
  <span class="practicelab" id="principle-no-facts-or-promises">
    APIs should be designed such that data returned through an API does not assert a fact or make a
    promise on the user's behalf about the user or their environment.
  </span>
</div>

Instead, the API could indicate a [=person=]'s preference, a [=person=]'s chosen identity, a
[=person=]'s query or interest, or a [=person=]'s selected communication style.

<div class="example">
For example, a [=user agent=] might support this principle by:

* Generating domain-specific email addresses or other directed identifiers so that [=people=] can
  log into the site without becoming recognisable across contexts.
* Offering the option to generate geolocation and accelerometry data with parameters specified by
  the [=user=].
* Uploading a stored video stream in response to a camera prompt.
* Automatically granting or denying permission prompts based on user configuration.

</div>

Sites should include deception in their threat modeling and not assume that web platform APIs
provide any guarantees of consistency, currency, or correctness about the user. People often have
control of the devices and software they use to interact with web sites. In response to site
requests, people may arbitrarily modify or select the information they provide for a
variety of reasons, including both malice and self-protection.

In any rare instances when an API must be defined as returning true current values, users may still

# Common Concepts {#boring-terminology}

## People {#people}

A <dfn data-lt="individual|people|user|data subject">person</dfn> (also [=user=] or
[=data subject=]) is any natural person. Throughout this document, we primarily use [=person=] or
[=people=] to refer to human beings, as a reminder of their humanity. When we use the term [=user=],
it is to talk about the specific [=person=] who happens to be using a given system at that time.

A <dfn data-lt="vulnerable">vulnerable person</dfn> in a particular [=context=]
is a [=person=] whose ability to make their own choices can be taken away more
easily than usual. Among other things, they should
be treated with greater default privacy protections and may be considered unable to
[=consent=] to various interactions with a system.
People can be vulnerable for different reasons, and some people may
be vulnerable in a specific [=context=]. For example, a child might
be vulnerable in many contexts, but a person in a position of power imbalance
with an employer or other [=actor=] might be vulnerable in the contexts
where that actor is also present.  See [[[#vulnerability]]].

## Contexts {#context}

A <dfn>context</dfn> is a physical or digital environment in which [=people=] interact with other
[=actors=], and which the [=people=] understand as distinct from other [=contexts=].

A [=context=] is not defined in terms of who owns or controls it. Sharing
[=data=] between different [=contexts=] of a single company can be
a [=privacy violation=], just as if the same data were shared between unrelated [=actors=].

## Server-Side Actors {#parties}

An <dfn>actor</dfn> is an entity that a [=person=] can reasonably understand as a single "thing"
they're interacting with. [=Actors=] can be [=people=] or collective entities like companies,
associations, or governmental bodies.

[=User agents=] tend to explain to [=people=] which [=origin=] or [=site=] provided the
web page they're looking at. The [=actor=] that makes or delegates decisions
about the content and [=data processing=] on this [=origin=] or [=site=] is
known as the web page's <dfn data-dfn-for="page">first party</dfn>. When a [=person=]
interacts with a part of a web page, the <dfn>first party</dfn> of that interaction
is usually the web page's [=page/first party=].
However, if a different [=actor=] makes the decisions about how that part of the
page works, and a reasonable person with a realistic amount of time and energy would realize
that this other [=actor=] has this control, this other
[=actor=] is the [=first party=] for the interaction instead.

If someone captures data about an interaction with a web page,
the [=first party=] of that interaction is accountable for the way that data is [=processed=],
even if another [=actor=] does the processing.

A <dfn data-lt="third parties">third party</dfn> is any [=actor=] other than the
[=person=] visiting the website or the [=first parties=] they expect to be interacting
with.

## Acting on Data {#acting-on-data}

We define <dfn data-lt="data">personal data</dfn> as any information that is directly or
indirectly related to an identified or identifiable [=person=], such as by reference to an
[=identifier=] ([[GDPR]], [[OECD-Guidelines]], [[Convention-108]]).

On the web, an <dfn>identifier</dfn> of some type is typically assigned for an
[=identity=] as seen by a website, which makes it easier for an automated
system to store data about that [=person=].

<aside class="example" id="example-identifiers" title="Identifiers">

Examples of [=identifiers=] for a [=person=] can be:

* their name,
* an identification number including those mapping to a device that this
[=person=] may be using,
* their phone number,
* their location data,
* an online identifier such as email or IP addresses,
* browser fingerprints (based on a combination of
  configuration characteristics), or
* factors specific to their physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic,
  cultural, social, or behavioral [=identity=],
* strings derived from other [=identifiers=], for instance through hashing.

</aside>

If a [=person=] could reasonably be identified or re-identified through the combination of [=data=] with other
[=data=], then both sets of [=data=] are [=personal data=].

[=People=] have <dfn>privacy</dfn> in a given [=context=] when [=actors=] in
that [=context=] follow that [=context=]'s principles when presenting
information and using [=personal data=].
When the principles for that [=context=] are not followed, there is a
<dfn>privacy violation</dfn>. We say that a particular interaction is
<dfn data-lt="appropriately">appropriate</dfn> when the principles are followed
or <dfn data-lt="inappropriately">inappropriate</dfn> otherwise.

An [=actor=] <dfn data-lt="process|processing|processed|data processing">processes</dfn> data if it
carries out operations on [=personal data=], whether or not by automated means, such as
collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration,
retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, [=sharing=], dissemination or
otherwise making available, [=selling=], alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or
destruction.

An [=actor=] <dfn data-lt="share|sharing">shares</dfn> data if it provides it to any other
[=data controller=]. Note that, under this definition, an [=actor=] that provides data to its own
[=service providers=] is not [=sharing=] it.

An [=actor=] <dfn data-lt="sell|selling">sells</dfn> data when it [=shares=] the data in exchange
for something of value, even if that value isn't monetary.

The <dfn>purpose</dfn> of a given [=processing=] of data is an anticipated, intended, or
planned outcome of this [=processing=] which is achieved or aimed for within a given
[=context=]. A [=purpose=], when described, should be specific enough that
someone familiar with the relevant [=context=] could pick some
[=means=] that would achieve the [=purpose=].

The <dfn>means</dfn> is the general way that data is [=processed=] to achieve a particular
[=purpose=], in a given [=context=]. [=Means=] are relatively abstract
and don't specify all the way down to implementation details. For example, for
the [=purpose=] of restoring a person's preferences, the [=means=] could be to
look up their identifier in a preferences store.

A <dfn>data controller</dfn> is an [=actor=] that determines the [=means=] and [=purposes=]
of data processing. Any [=actor=] that is not a [=service provider=] is a [=data controller=].

A <dfn data-lt="data processor">service provider</dfn> or [=data processor=]:

* [=processes=] data on behalf of another [=actor=];
* ensures that the data is only retained, accessed, and used as directed by that
  [=actor=] and solely for the list of explicitly-specified [=purposes=]
  detailed by the directing [=actor=];
* may determine implementation details of the data processing in question but
  does not determine the [=purpose=] for which the data is being [=processed=]
  nor the overarching [=means=] through which the [=purpose=] is carried out;
* has no independent right to use the data other than in a [=de-identified=] form (e.g., for
  monitoring service integrity, load balancing, capacity planning, or billing); and,
* has a contract in place with the [=actor=] which is consistent with the above limitations.

## Recognition {#recognition}

<dfn data-lt="recognize|recognized">Recognition</dfn> is the act of realising that a given [=identity=]
corresponds to the same [=person=] as another [=identity=] which may have been
observed either in another [=context=], or in the same [=context=] but at a
different time. [=Recognition=] can be probabilistic, if someone realises there's
a high probability that two [=identities=] correspond to the same [=person=],
even if they aren't certain.

A [=person=] can be [=recognized=] whether or not their legal identity or
characteristics of their legal identity are included in the recognition.

### Recognition Types {#recognition-types}

There are several types of [=recognition=] that may take place.

<dfn>Cross-context recognition</dfn> is [=recognition=] between different
[=contexts=].

[=Cross-context recognition=] is only [=appropriate=] when the person being [=recognized=]
can reasonably expect recognition to happen, and can control whether it does.

If a person uses a piece of identifying information in two different
contexts (e.g. their email or phone number), this *does not* automatically
mean that they intend to use the same identity in both contexts. It is
[=inappropriate=] to [=recognize=] them using that information, unless there's
some other indication that they intended to use a single identity. It is also
[=inappropriate=] to seek extra identifying information to help with
cross-context recognition.

Systems which [=recognize=] people across [=contexts=] need
to be careful not to apply the principles of one [=context=] in ways that
violate the principles around use of information acquired in a different
[=context=]. This is particularly true for [=vulnerable people=], as
recognising them in different [=contexts=] may force traits into the open
that reveal their vulnerability. For example, if you meet your therapist at a
party, you expect them to have different discussion topics with you than they
usually would, and possibly even to pretend they don't know you.

<dfn>Cross-site recognition</dfn> is [=recognition=] when the identities
are observed on different [=sites=]. In the usual case that the sites are
different [=contexts=],
[=cross-site recognition=] is [=inappropriate=] in the same cases as [=cross-context recognition=].

<dfn>Same-site recognition</dfn> is when a single [=site=] [=recognizes=] a
[=person=] across two or more visits.

A privacy harm occurs if a [=person=] reasonably expects that they'll be using
a different [=identity=] for different visits to a single site, but the site
[=recognizes=] them anyway.

Note that these categories overlap: [=cross-site recognition=] is usually
[=cross-context recognition=] (and always [=recognizes=] across [=partitions=]); and
[=same-site recognition=] is sometimes [=cross-context recognition=] (and may or may not
involve multiple [=partitions=]).

### User agent awareness of recognition {#user-agent-recognition}

A <dfn>partition</dfn> is the [=user agent=]'s attempt to match how its user
would understand a [=context=]. [=User agents=] don't have a perfect
understanding of how their users experience the sites they visit, so they
often need to approximate the boundaries between [=contexts=] when building
[=partitions=].

In the absence of better information, a [=partition=] can be defined as:

* a set of [=environments=] (roughly: same-site and cross-site [^iframe^]s,
workers, and top-level pages)
* whose [=environment/top-level origins=] are in the [=same site=] (note: see
[[PSL-Problems]])
* being visited within the same user agent installation (and browser profile,
container, or container tab for user agents that support those features)
* between points in time that the person or user agent clears that [=site=]'s
cookies and other storage (which is sometimes automatic at the end of each
session).

It can be difficult for a [=user agent=] to detect when a single site contains
multiple [=contexts=]. When a [=user agent=] can detect this, it should adjust
its [=partitions=] accordingly, for instance by partitioning identities
per subdomain or site path. User agents should work to improve their ability to
distinguish contexts within a site.

[=User agents=] should prevent people from being
[=recognized=] across [=partitions=] unless they intend to be
recognized.

Note that sites can do harm even if they can't be completely certain
that visits come from the same person, so [=user agents=] should also take steps
to prevent such probabilistic recognition. The [[[Privacy-Threat]]] discusses
the tradeoffs involved ([[Privacy-Threat]]).

If a [=user agent=] can tell that its user is using a particular identity on a
website, it should make that active identity clear to the user (e.g. if the
user logged into the site via an API like [[[credential-management-1]]]).

# High-Level Threats {#threats}

User agents should attempt to defend the people using them from a variety of high-level
threats or attacker goals, described in this section.

These threats are an extension of the ones discussed by [[RFC6973]].

<dl>
<dt><dfn>Correlation</dfn>

<dd> Correlation is the combination of various pieces of information related to an
    individual or that obtain that characteristic when combined. See
    <a
data-cite="RFC6973#section-5.2.1">RFC6973§5.2.1</a>.

<dt>Data Compromise

<dd> End systems that do not take adequate measures to secure data from
    unauthorized or inappropriate access. See <a
    data-cite="RFC6973#section-5.1.2">RFC6973§5.1.2</a>.

<dt><dfn>Disclosure</dfn>

<dd>Disclosure is the revelation of information about an individual that affects
    the way others judge the individual. See <a
data-cite="RFC6973#section-5.2.4">RFC6973§5.2.4</a>.

<dt>Exclusion

<dd>Exclusion is the failure to allow individuals to know about the data that
    others have about them and to participate in its handling and use. See
    <a
data-cite="RFC6973#section-5.2.5">RFC6973§5.2.5</a>.

<dt>Identification

<dd>Identification is the linking of information to a particular individual, even if the information
isn't linked to that individual's real-world identity (e.g. their legal name, address, government ID
number, etc.). Identifying someone allows a system to treat them differently from others, which can
be [=inappropriate=] depending on the [=context=]. See
<a data-cite="RFC6973#section-5.2.2">RFC6973§5.2.2</a>.

<dt><dfn>Intrusion</dfn>

<dd> [=Intrusion=] consists of invasive acts that disturb or interrupt one’s life or
    activities. See <a
    data-cite="RFC6973#section-5.1.3">RFC6973§5.1.3</a>.

<dt>Misattribution

<dd> Misattribution occurs when data or communications related to one individual
    are attributed to another. See <a
data-cite="RFC6973#section-5.1.4">RFC6973§5.1.4</a>.

<dt>Profiling</dt>

<dd>The inference, evaluation, or prediction of an individual's attributes, interests, or
behaviours.</dd>

<dt><dfn>Secondary Use</dfn>

<dd> Secondary use is the use of collected information about an individual without
    the individual’s consent for a purpose different from that for which the
    information was collected. See <a
data-cite="RFC6973#section-5.2.3">RFC6973§5.2.3</a>.

<dt><dfn>Surveillance</dfn>

<dd> Surveillance is the observation or monitoring of an individual’s
communications or activities. See <a
data-cite="RFC6973#section-5.1.1">RFC6973§5.1.1</a>.

These threats combine into the particular concrete threats we want web
specifications to defend against, described in the sections that follow.

# Conformance

This document does not adhere to strict [[?RFC2119]] terminology because it is primarily of
an informative nature and does not easily lend itself to constraining a conformance class.
However, within the formulation of its principles, we have taken care to use "should" to indicate
that a principle can be overridden in some rare cases given that there are valid reasons for doing so and
"must" to indicate that we can see no situation in which deviating from the principle could
be justified.
