<section id="abstract">

Privacy has been an essentially contested concept [[?PRIVACY-CONTESTED]]. Its debated meaning
render its support problematic in the context of a standards-setting process grounded in
consensus [[?W3C-PROCESS]], in seeking out technical solutions grounded on shared
requirements, and in addressing the needs of a worldwide constituency. This document
provides definitions for privacy and related concepts that are suitable for a global
audience, that can provide building blocks for privacy threat modelling, and can guide the
development of the Web as a trustworthy platform. In the spirit of building a much-needed
bridge between technology and policy, this document is written under the expectation that
it can apply to both.

</section>

<section id="sotd">

This document is a draft Finding by a Task Force jointly convened by the
Technical Architecture Group (TAG) and the Privacy Interest Group (PING). It
does not contain any normative content.

This document <strong>DOES NOT YET</strong> reflect the consensus of the Task Force. It will
continue to evolve and the Task Force will issue updates as often as needed. At
the conclusion of the Task Force, it is intended to be adopted by the TAG.

# Introduction {#intro}

Privacy is essential to trust, and trust is a cornerstone value of the Web [[?RFC8890]].
In much of everyday life, people have little difficulty assessing whether a given flow of
information constitutes a violation of privacy or not [[?NYT-PRIVACY]]. However, in the digital
space, users struggle to understand how their data may flow between contexts and how such
flows may affect them, not just immediately but at a much later time and in completely
different situations. Some actors then seize upon this confusion in order to extract and
exploit [=personal data=] at unprecedented scale.

The goal of this document is to define all the terms that may prove useful in developing
technology and policy that relate to privacy and [=personal data=]. It additionally provides
a toolbox to support the common need that is privacy threat modelling, the frequent debate
over consent, and the under-developed set of issues in privacy that are of a
collective, relational nature.

[=Personal data=] is a regulated object, and this document naturally recognises the
jurisdictional primacy of existing data protection regimes. However, the global nature of
the Web means that, as we develop technology, we benefit from shared concepts that guide the
evolution of the Web as a system built for its users [[?RFC8890]]. A clear and well-defined
view of privacy on the Web, grounded in an up-to-date understanding of the state of the art,
can hopefully help the Web's constituencies thrive across jurisdictional disparity, with the
shared understanding that the law is a floor, not a ceiling.

# Definitions {#definitions}

This section provides a number of elementary building blocks from which to establish a
shared understanding of privacy. Some of the definitions below build atop the work in
<em>Tracking Preference Expression (DNT)</em> [[tracking-dnt]].

## People &amp; Data {#people-data}

A <dfn>user</dfn> (also <dfn data-lt="individual">person</dfn> or <dfn>data subject</dfn>)
is any natural person.

We define <dfn data-lt="data">personal data</dfn> as any information relating to a
[=person=] such that:

* The [=data=] references this [=person=] directly, for instance through their name,
  email address, phone number, or other such traditional identifiers.
* The [=data=] can identify this [=person=] through an arbitrary string or identification
  number, an online identifier such as an IP address or any identifier attached to a
  device which this [=person=] may be using.
* The [=data=] is about a [=person=]'s location (or of a device that a [=person=] would use).
* The [=data=] contains factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental,
  economic, cultural, or social identity of a [=person=].
* The [=data=] is comprised of identifiers derived from other types of data in this list,
  for instance through hashing.
* The [=person=] could reasonably be reidentified from a conjunction of this
  [=data=] with other data.
* The [=data=] relates to a group of people such that a [=person=] may be treated in a
  specific way for being part of the group, even if the entity treating them in this
  manner has no way to identify that [=person=].

Data is <dfn>permanently de-identified</dfn> when there exists a high level of confidence
that no [=person=] described by the data can be identified, directly or indirectly
(e.g. via association with an identifier, user agent, or device), by that data alone or in
combination with other available information, including as being part of a group. Note
that further considerations relating to groups are covered in the
<a href="#collective">Collective Issues in Privacy</a> section.

Data is <dfn data-lt="pseudonymous data|pseudonymity">pseudonymous</dfn> when there are
strict controls that prevent the reidentification of [=people=] described by the data
except for a well-defined set of [=purposes=]. There are two cases in which [=data=]
can be considered [=pseudonymous=], and they have different constraints.

If the [=pseudonymous data=] is <em>only</em> being processed by one [=party=]:

* the identifiers used in the data must be unique to that dataset; and

* any person (e.g. an employee of the [=party=]) with access to the [=data=] is
  barred (e.g. based on legal terms) from sharing the [=data=] further; and

* technical measures exist to prevent re-identification or the joining of
  different data sets involving this [=data=], notably against timing or
  k-anonymity attacks.

If the [=pseudonymous data=] is shared between several [=parties=]:

* the identifiers used in the [=data=] are under the direct and exclusive control of
  the [=first party=]; and

* when these identifiers are shared with a [=third party=], they are made unique
  to that [=third party=] such that if they are shared with more than one
  [=third party=] these cannot then match them up with one another; and

* there is a strong level of confidence that no [=third party=] can match the [=data=]
  with any data other than that obtained through interactions with the [=first
  party=]; and

* any [=third party=] receiving such [=data=] is barred (eg. based on legal terms)
  from sharing it further; and

* technical measures exist to prevent re-identification or the joining of
  different data sets involving this [=data=], notably against timing or
  k-anonymity attacks; and

* there exist contractual terms between the [=first party=] and [=third party=]
  describing the limited [=purpose=] for which the data is being shared.

This can ensure that [=pseudonymous data=] is used in a manner that provides a minimum
degree of governance such that technical and procedural means to guarantee the
maintenance of pseudonymity are preserved. Note that [=pseudonymity=], on its own, is not
sufficient to render [=data processing=] [=appropriate=].

A <dfn data-lt="vulnerable">vulnerable person</dfn> is a [=person=] who, at least in the [=context=] of
the [=processing=] being discussed, are unable to exercise sufficient
self-determination for any consent they may provide to be receivable. This includes for
example children, employees with respect to their employers, people in some situations of
intellectual or psychological impairment, or refugees.

## The Parties {#parties}

A <dfn>party</dfn> is a [=person=], a legal entity, or a set of legal entities that
share common owners, common controllers, and a group identity that is readily evident to
the [=user=] without them needing to consult additional material, typically through
common branding.

The <dfn data-lt="first parties">first party</dfn> is a [=party=] with which the [=user=] intends to
interact. Merely hovering over, muting, pausing, or closing a given piece of content does
not constitute a [=user=]'s intent to interact with another party, nor does the simple
fact of loading a [=party=] embedded in the one with which the user intends to
interact. In cases of clear and conspicuous joint branding, there can be multiple [=first
parties=]. The [=first party=] is necessarily a [=data controller=] of the data processing
that takes places as a consequence of a [=user=] interacting with it.

A <dfn data-lt="third parties">third party</dfn> is any [=party=] other than the [=user=],
the [=first party=], or a [=service provider=] acting on behalf of either the [=user=] or
the [=first party=].

A <dfn>service provider</dfn> or <dfn>data processor</dfn> is considered to be the same
[=party=] as the entity contracting it to perform the relevant [=processing=] if it:

* is processing the data on behalf of that [=party=];
* ensures that the data is only retained, accessed, and used as directed by that
  [=party=] and solely for the list of explicitly-specified [=purposes=]
  detailed by the directing [=party=] or [=data controller=];
* may determine implementation details of the data processing in question but
  does not determine the [=purpose=] for which the data is being [=processed=]
  nor the overarching [=means=] through which the [=purpose=] is carried out;
* has no independent right to use the data other than in a [=permanently
  de-identified=] form (e.g., for monitoring service integrity, load balancing,
  capacity planning, or billing); and,
* has a contract in place with the [=party=] which is consistent with the above limitations.

A <dfn>data controller</dfn> is a [=party=] that determines the [=means=] and [=purposes=]
of data processing. Any [=party=] that is not a [=service provider=] is a [=data controller=].

The <dfn>Vegas Rule</dfn> is a simple implementation of privacy in which "<em>what happens
with the [=first party=] stays with the [=first party=]</em>." Put differently, it
describes a situation in which the [=first party=] is the only [=data controller=]. Note
that, while enforcing the [=Vegas Rule=] provides a rule of thumb describing a necessary
baseline for [=appropriate=] [=data processing=], it is not always sufficient to guarantee
[=appropriate=] [=processing=] since the [=first party=] can [=process=] data
[=inappropriately=].

## Acting on Data {#acting-on-data}

A [=party=] <dfn data-lt="process|processing|processed|data processing">processes</dfn> data if it
carries out operations on [=personal data=], whether or not by automated means, such as
collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration,
retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, [=sharing=], dissemination or
otherwise making available, [=selling=], alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or
destruction.

A [=party=] <dfn data-lt="share|sharing">shares</dfn> data if it provides it to any other
[=party=]. Note that, under this definition, a [=party=] that provides data to its own
[=service providers=] is not [=sharing=] it.

A [=party=] <dfn data-lt="sell|selling">sells</dfn> data when it [=shares=] it in exchange
for consideration, monetary or otherwise.

## Contexts and Privacy

The <dfn>purpose</dfn> of a given [=processing=] of data is an anticipated, intended, or
planned outcome of this [=processing=] which is achieved or aimed for within a given
[=context=]. A [=purpose=], when described, should be specific enough to be actionable by
someone familiar with the relevant [=context=] (ie. they could independently determine
[=means=] that reasonably correspond to an implementation of the [=purpose=]).

<!--
XXX given that contexts are defined from *user* purpose we might wish to have purpose in
general and processing purpose for the above.
-->

The <dfn>means</dfn> are the general method of [=data processing=] through which a given
[=purpose=] is implemented, in a given [=context=], considered at a relatively abstract
level and not necessarily all the way down to implementation details. Example:
<em>the user will have their preferences restored (purpose) by looking up their identifier
in a preferences store (means)</em>.

A <dfn>context</dfn> is a physical or digital environment that a [=person=] interacts with
for a purpose of their own (that they typically share with other [=person=] who interact
with the same environment).

A [=context=] can be further described through:

* Its <dfn>actors</dfn>, which comprise the <dfn>subject</dfn> (a [=person=]) as well as
  the <dfn>sender</dfn> and <dfn>recipient</dfn> of the data (which are [=parties=]).
* Its <dfn>attributes</dfn>, which are the types of [=personal data=] being [=processed=]
  in the [=context=].
* Its <dfn>transmission principles</dfn>, which are the constraints (typically technical
  or legal) being placed upon the [=data processing=].

A [=context=] carries <dfn data-lt="norm">context-relative informational norms</dfn> that determine
whether a given [=data processing=] is <dfn data-lt="appropriately">appropriate</dfn>
(if the norms are adhered to) or <dfn data-lt="inappropriately">inappropriate</dfn>
(when the norms are violated). A norm violation can be for instance the exfiltration of
[=personal data=] from a context or the lack of respect for [=transmission principles=].
When [=norms=] are respected in a given [=context=], we can say that <dfn>contextual
integrity</dfn> is maintained; otherwise that it is violated ([[?PRIVACY-IN-CONTEXT]],
[[?PRIVACY-AS-CI]]).

We define <dfn>privacy</dfn> as a right to [=appropriate=] [=data processing=]. A
<dfn>privacy violation</dfn> is, correspondingly, [=inappropriate=] [=data processing=]
[[?PRIVACY-IN-CONTEXT]].

Note that a [=first party=] can be comprised of multiple [=contexts=] if it is large
enough that [=people=] would interact with it for more than one [=purpose=]. [=Sharing=]
[=personal data=] across [=contexts=] is, in the overwhelming majority of cases,
[=inappropriate=].

<div class="example">

Your cute little pup uses <em>Poodle Naps</em> to find comfortable places to snooze,
and <em>Poodle Fetch</em> to locate the best sticks. Napping and fetching are different
[=contexts=] with different norms, and sharing data between these contexts is a
[=privacy violation=] despite the shared ownership of <em>Naps</em> and <em>Fetch</em>
by the <em>Poodle</em> conglomerate.

</div>

Colloquially, <dfn>tracking</dfn> is understood to be any kind of [=inappropriate=] data
collection.

Additionally, <dfn data-lt="privacy-labor">privacy labour</dfn> is the practice of having
a [=person=] carry out the work of ensuring [=data processing=] of which they are the
subject is [=appropriate=], instead of having the [=parties=] be responsible for that
work as is more respectable.

## User Agents {#user-agents}

The <dfn>user agent</dfn> acts as an intermediary between a [=user=] and the web. The
[=user agent=] is <em>not</em> a [=context=] in that it is expected to coincide with the
[=subject=] and operate exclusively in the [=subject=]'s interest. It is <em>not</em> the
[=first party=]. The [=user agent=] serves the [=user=] in a
<dfn data-lt="fiduciary relationship">relationship of fiduciary agency</dfn>: it always puts
the [=user=]'s interest first, up to and including, on occasion, protecting the [=user=]
from themselves by preventing them from carrying out a harmful decision, or at the very
least by speed-bumping it [[?FIDUCIARY-UA]]. For example, the [=user agent=] will make it
difficult for the [=user=] to connect to a site the authenticity of which is hard to
ascertain, will double-check that the user really intends to expose a sensitive device
capability, or will prevent the [=user=] from consenting to permanent monitoring of their
behaviour. Its <dfn>fiduciary duties</dfn> include [[?TAKING-TRUST-SERIOUSLY]]:

<dl>
  <dt><dfn>Duty of Protection</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
    Protection requires [=user agents=] to affirmatively protect a [=user=]'s data, beyond
    simple security measures. It is insufficient simply to encrypt at rest and in transit,
    but one must further limit retention, ensure that the strictly necessary data is
    collected, or require guarantees from those it is shared to.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>Duty of Discretion</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
    Discretion requires the [=user agent=] to make best efforts to enforce
    [=context-relative informational norms=] by placing contextual limits on the flow and
    [=processing=] of [=personal data=]. Discretion is not confidentiality and may place
    limits on nondisclosure: trust can be preserved even when the [=user agent=] shares the
    [=personal data=], so long as it is done in an [=appropriately=] discreet manner.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>Duty of Honesty</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
    Honesty requires that the [=user agent=] make sure that the [=user=] is proactively
    provided with information that is relevant to them and that will enhance the [=user=]'s
    autonomy, to the extent possible in a manner that they will comprehend and at the right
    moment, which is almost never when the [=user=] is trying to do something else such as
    read a page or activate a feature. The duty of honesty goes well beyond that of
    transparency that dominates legacy privacy regimes. Unlike with transparency, honesty
    cannot get away with hiding relevant information in complex out-of-band legal notices
    no more than it can rely on overly cursory information provided in a consent dialog.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>Duty of Loyalty</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
    Because of the special [=fiduciary relationship=] that obtains between [=user=] and
    [=user agent=], the latter is held to be loyal to the former in all situations, up to and
    including in preference to the [=user agent=]'s implementer. When a [=user agent=] carries
    out [=processing=] that is not directly in the [=user=]'s interest but rather benefits
    another entity such as its implementer, including by piggybacking on [=processing=] that
    may be in the user's interest, that behaviour is known as <dfn>self-dealing</dfn>.
    [=Self-dealing=] is always [=inappropriate=]. Loyalty is the avoidance of [=self-dealing=].
  </dd>
</dl>

These duties ensure the [=user agent=] will <em>care</em> for the user. It is important to
note that there is a subtle difference between care and <dfn>data paternalism</dfn> which
is that the latter purports to help in part by removing agency ("<em>don't worry about it,
so long as your data is with us it's safe, you don't need to know what we do with it, it's
all good because we're good people</em>") whereas care aims to support people by enhancing
their agency and sovereignty.


## Identity on the Web {#identity}

A [=person=]'s <dfn>identity</dfn> is the set of characteristics that define them. In
computer systems, [=identity=] is typically attached to a means of denotation that makes
it easier for an automated system to recognise the user, an <dfn>identifier</dfn> of
some type.

A [=person=]'s characteristics, and therefore [=identity=], is entirely
[=context=]-dependent. Recognising a [=person=] in distinct [=contexts=] can at times be
[=appropriate=] but this relies on an understanding of applicable [=norms=] and will
likely require compartmentalisation. (For example, if you meet your therapist at a
cocktail party, you expect them to have rather different discussion topics with you than
they usually would, and possibly even to pretend they do not know you.) As a result,
automating the recognition of a [=person=]'s identity across different [=contexts=] is
[=inappropriate=]. This is particularly true for [=vulnerable=] people as recognising them
in different [=contexts=] may force their vulnerability into the open.

[=Identity=] being by nature fragmented, [=user agents=] must work in support of [=users=]
having different identities in different [=context=] with respect to <em>all</em> [=parties=]
(including the user agent vendor) and to prevent their recognition through other means,
where possible.

A keystone principle of the Web is trust [[RFC8890]]. An important part of trust is to
ensure that [=data=] collected for a [=purpose=] that matches a clearly delineated [=user=]
feature should not then be used for additional secondary [=purposes=]. Email is often used
for login and communication [=purposes=], including essential transactional interactions.
Using emails for cross-context recognition [=purposes=] is therefore not only
[=inappropriate=] but also threatens key messaging infrastructure. Future iterations of
the Web platform should ensure that users can log into sites and receive communication
without relying on email at all.

## User Control and Autonomy {#autonomy}

A [=person=]'s <dfn data-lt="autonomous">autonomy</dfn> is their ability to make decisions of their own volition,
without undue influence from other parties. People have limited intellectual resources and
time with which to weigh decisions, and by necessity rely on shortcuts when making
decisions. This makes their privacy preferences malleable [[?PRIVACY-BEHAVIOR]] and susceptible to
manipulation [[?DIGITAL-MARKET-MANIPULATION]]. A [=person=]'s [=autonomy=] is enhanced by a
system or device when that system offers a shortcut that aligns more with what that [=person=] would
have decided given arbitrary amounts of time and relatively unfettered intellectual ability;
and [=autonomy=] is decreased when a similar shortcut goes against decisions made under
ideal conditions.

Affordances and interactions that decrease [=autonomy=] are known as <dfn>dark patterns</dfn>.
A [=dark pattern=] does not have to be intentional, the deceptive effect is sufficient to
define them [[?DARK-PATTERNS]], [[?DARK-PATTERN-DARK]].

Because we are all subject to motivated reasoning, the design of defaults and affordances
that may impact [=user=] [=autonomy=] should be the subject of independent scrutiny.
Implementers are enjoined to be particularly cautious to avoid slipping into
[=data paternalism=].

Given the sheer volume of potential [=data=]-related decisions in today's data economy,
complete informational self-determination is impossible. This fact, however, should not be
confused with the contention that privacy is dead. Careful design of our technological
infrastructure can ensure that [=users=]' [=autonomy=] as pertaining to their own [=data=]
is enhanced through [=appropriate=] defaults and choice architectures.

In the 1970s, the <dfn>Fair Information Practices</dfn> or <dfn>FIPs</dfn> were elaborated
in support of individual [=autonomy=] in the face of growing concerns with databases. The
[=FIPs=] assume that there is sufficiently little [=data processing=] taking place that any
[=person=] will be able to carry out sufficient diligence to enable [=autonomy=] in their
decision-making. Since they entirely offload the [=privacy labour=]
to [=users=] and assume perfect, unfettered [=autonomy=], the [=FIPs=] do not forbid specific
types of [=data processing=] but only place them under different procedural requirements.
Such an approach is [=appropriate=] for [=parties=] that are processing data in the 1970s.

One notable issue with procedural approaches to privacy is that they tend to have the same
requirements in situations where the [=user=] finds themselves in a significant asymmetry of
power with a [=party=] — for instance the [=user=] of an essential service provided by a
monopolistic platform — and those where [=user=] and [=parties=] are very much on equal
footing, or even where the [=user=] may have greater power, as is the case with small
businesses operating in a competitive environment. It further does not consider cases in
which one [=party=] may coerce other [=parties=] into facilitating its [=inappropriate=]
practices, as is often the case with dominant players in advertising [[?CONSENT-LACKEYS]] or
in content aggregation [[?CAT]].

Reference to the [=FIPs=] survives to this day. They are often referenced as <em>transparency
and choice</em>, which, in today's digital environment, is often a strong indication that
[=inappropriate=] [=processing=] is being described.

<figcaption>
  A method of privacy regulation which promises honesty and autonomy but delivers neither.
  [[?CONFIDING]].
</figcaption>
</figure>

## Opt-in, Consent, Opt-out, Global Controls {#opt-in-out}

Different procedural mechanisms exist to enable [=people=] to control the [=processing=]
done to their [=data=]. Mechanisms that increase the number of [=purposes=] for which
their [=data=] is being [=processed=] are referred to as <dfn data-lt="opt in">opt-in</dfn> or
<dfn>consent</dfn>; mechanisms that decrease this number of [=purposes=] are known as
<dfn data-lt="opt out">opt-out</dfn>.

When deployed thoughtfully, these mechanisms can enhance [=people=]'s [=autonomy=]. Often,
however, they are used as a way to avoid putting in the difficult work of deciding which
types of [=processing=] are [=appropriate=] and which are not, offloading [=privacy labour=]
to the [=user=].

Privacy regulatory regimes are often anchored at extremes: either they default to allowing
only very few strictly essential [=purposes=] such that many [=parties=] will have to
resort to [=consent=], habituating [=people=] to ignore legal prompts and incentivising
[=dark patterns=], or, conversely, they default to forbidding only very few, particularly
egregious [=purposes=], such that [=people=] will have to perform the [=privacy labour=] to
[=opt out=] in every [=context=] in order to produce [=appropriate=] [=processing=].

An approach that is more aligned with the expectation that the Web should provide a
trustworthy, [=person=]-centric environment is to establish a regime consisting of
three privacy tiers:

<dl>
  <dt><dfn>Default Privacy Tier</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
    This is the set of [=purposes=] that are deemed [=appropriate=] in a given [=context=]
    and the [=processing=] that a [=person=] can expect without having triggered any
    mechanisms to change their preferences. The exact details for this tier require clear
    definition, including aspects such as data retention, but [=data=] would have to be
    systematically siloed by [=context=] (<em>not</em> by [=party=], making it stricter than
    the [=Vegas Rule=] and more in line with respecting [=privacy=]). This default tier
    should also be defined differently for certain kinds of [=contexts=]. The legitimate
    [=processing=] that can take place in this tier derives its legitimacy from matching the
    expectations and interests of both the [=user=] and the [=first party=] in their
    relationship, as guided by the applicable [=norms=]. This tier is more [=appropriate=] the more the
    [=first party=] acts in accordance with [=fiduciary duties=].
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>Opt-out Privacy Tier</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
    [=People=] who, either from personal preference or because they are [=vulnerable=],
    require greater obscurity in some or even most [=contexts=], would be able to transition
    to this tier through an [=opt-out=] mechanism. This tier would only permit strictly
    necessary [=purposes=]. This tier should be [=appropriate=] for [=vulnerable=]
    [=people=].
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn>Opt-in Privacy Tier</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
    In rare and highly specific cases, [=people=] should be able to [=consent=] to more
    sensitive [=purposes=], such as having their [=identity=] recognised across contexts or
    their reading history shared with a company. The burden of proof on ensuring that informed [=consent=] has
    been obtained needs in this case to be very high (much higher than what prevails for
    instance in [[?GDPR]] jurisdictions as currently practices). [=Consent=] is comparable to the general problem
    of permissions on the Web platform. In the same way that it should be clear when a given
    device capability is in use (eg. you are providing geolocation or camera access), sharing
    data under this tier should be set up in such a way that it requires deliberate, specific
    action from the [=user=] (eg. triggering a form control) and if that [=consent=] is
    persistent, there should be an indicator that data is being transmitted shown at all
    times, in such a way that the user can easily switch it off. In general, providing
    [=consent=] should be rare, difficult, highly intentional, and temporary.
  </dd>
</dl>

When an [=opt-out=] mechanism exists, it should preferably be complemented by a
<dfn>global opt-out</dfn> mechanism. The function of a [=global opt-out=] mechanism is to
rectify the <dfn>automation asymmetry</dfn> whereby service providers can automate
[=data processing=] but [=people=] have to take manual action. A good example of a
[=global opt-out=] mechanism is the <em>Global Privacy Control</em> [[?GPC]].

Conceptually, a [=global opt-out=] mechanism is an automaton operating as part of the
[=user agent=], which is to say that it is equivalent to a robot that would carry out the
[=user=]'s bidding by pressing an [=opt-out=] button with every interaction that the
[=user=] has with a site, or more generally conveys an expression of the [=user=]'s
rights in a relevant jurisdiction. (For instance, under [[?GDPR]], the [=user=] may be
conveying objections to [=processing=] based on legitimate interest or the withdrawal of
[=consent=] to specific [=purposes=].) It should be noted that, since a [=global opt-out=]
signal is reaffirmed automatically with every [=user=] interaction, it will take precedence
in terms of specificity over any manner of blanket [=consent=] that a site may obtain,
unless that [=consent=] is directly attached to an interaction (eg. terms specified on a
form upon submission).

## Collective Issues in Privacy {#collective}

When designing Web technology, we naturally pay attention to potential impacts on the [=person=]
using the Web through their [=user agent=]. In addition to potential individual harms we also
pay heed to collective effects that emerge from the accumulation of individual actions as
influenced by entities and the structure of technology.

Note that in evaluating impact, we deliberately ignore what implementers or specifiers may
have <em>intended</em> and only focus on outcomes. This framing is known as <dfn>POSIWID</dfn>, or
"<em>the Purpose Of a System Is What It Does</em>".

The collective problem of privacy is known as <dfn>legibility</dfn>. [=Legibility=] concerns
population-level [=data processing=] that may impact populations or individuals, including in
ways that [=people=] could not control even under the optimistic assumptions of the [=FIPs=].
For example, based on population-level analysis, a company may know that <var>site.example</var>
is predominantly visited by [=people=] of a given race or gender, and decide not to run its
job ads there. Visitors to that page are implicitly having their [=data=] processed in
[=inappropriate=] ways, with no way to discover the discrimination or seek relief
[[?DEMOCRATIC-DATA]].

What we consider is therefore not just the relation between the people who expose themselves
and the entities that invite that disclosure [[?RELATIONAL-TURN]], but also between the people
who expose themselves and those who do not but may find themselves recognised as such indirectly
anyway. One key understanding here is that such relations may persists even when data is
[=permanently de-identified=].

[=Legibility=] practices can be <dfn data-lt="legitimacy">legitimate</dfn> or
<dfn data-lt="illegitimacy">illegitimate</dfn> depending
on the [=context=] and on the [=norms=] that apply in that [=context=]. Typically, a
[=legibility=] practice may be [=legitimate=] if it is managed through an acceptable process
of collective [=governance=]. For example, it is often considered [=legitimate=] for a
government, under the control of its citizens, to maintain a database of license plates for
the [=purpose=] of enforcing the rules of the road. It would be [=illegitimate=] to observe
the same license plates near places of worship to build a database of religious identity.

[=Legibility=] is often used to order information about the world. This can notably create
problems of [=reflexivity=] and of [=autonomy=].

Problems of <dfn>reflexivity</dfn> occur when the ordering of information about the world
used to produce [=legibility=] finds itself changing the way in which the world operates.
This can produce self-reinforcing loops that can have deleterious effects both individual and
collective [[?SEEING-LIKE-A-STATE]].

Issues of [=autonomy=] occur depending on the manner in which [=legibility=] is implemented.
When [=legibility=] is used to order the world following rules set by the [=user=] or
following methods subject to public scrutiny and [=governance=] models with strong checks and
balances (such as a newspaper's editorial decisions), then it will enhance [=user=] [=autonomy=]
and tend to be [=legitimate=]. When it is done in the [=user=]'s stead and without [=governance=],
it decreases [=user=] [=autonomy=] and tends to be [=illegitimate=].

<!--
<p>
From an economics standpoint, it is important to note that the broad sharing of data can lead
to anticompetitive outcomes, notably due to network effects stemming from processing data across
multiple [=contexts=] [[?BIG-DATA-COMPETITION]]. Restricting flows of [=data=] between
different [=contexts=] (and not just [=parties=]) is therefore likely to improve competition.
</p>
-->

<dfn data-lt="governance">Data governance</dfn> refers to the rules and processes for how [=data=] is
[=processed=] in any given [=context=]. How data is <em>governed</em> describes who has
power to make decisions over [=data=] and how [[?DATA-FUTURES-GLOSSARY]].

In general, collective issues in [=data=] require collective solutions. The proper goal of
[=data governance=] at the standards-setting level is the development of structural controls
in [=user agents=] and the provision of institutions that can handle population-level problems
in [=data=]. [=Governance=] will often struggle to achieve its goals if it works primarily by
increasing <em>individual</em> control over [=data=]. A collective approach reduces the cost of
control.

Collecting data at large scales can have significant pro-social outcomes. Problems tend to
emerge when entities take part in dual-use collection in which [=data=] is [=processed=]
for collective benefit but also for [=self-dealing=] [=purposes=] that may degrade welfare.
The [=self-dealing=] [=purposes=] will be justified as bankrolling the pro-social outcomes,
which, absent collective oversight, cannot be considered to support claims to [=legitimacy=]
for such [=legibility=]. It is vital for standards-setting organisations to establish not
just purely technical devices but techno-social systems that can govern data at scale.

<!--
Imagine a case in which collecting browser data can be leveraged to improve both search
services (which have a business model) and user security (which generally doesn't). This
data could be collected through a data trust under stakeholder governance, search
companies paying for access with strong checks and balances, and privacy guarantees, and
the funds would be used to support enhanced security for all.
-->

# Privacy principles by category {#principles}

User agents should attempt to defend their users from a variety of high-level
threats or attacker goals, described in this section.

[[RFC6973]] describes the following high-level privacy threats, which the TAG
has adopted into the <a data-cite="security-privacy-questionnaire#threats">
Security and Privacy Self-Review Questionnaire</a>:

<dl>
<dt><dfn>Surveillance</dfn>

<dd> Surveillance is the observation or monitoring of an individual’s
communications or activities. See <a
data-cite="RFC6973#section-5.1.1">RFC6973§5.1.1</a>.

<dt><dfn>Stored Data Compromise</dfn>

<dd> End systems that do not take adequate measures to secure stored data from
    unauthorized or inappropriate access. See <a
    data-cite="RFC6973#section-5.1.2">RFC6973§5.1.2</a>.

<dt><dfn>Intrusion</dfn>

<dd> Intrusion consists of invasive acts that disturb or interrupt one’s life or
    activities. See <a
    data-cite="RFC6973#section-5.1.3">RFC6973§5.1.3</a>.

<dt><dfn>Misattribution</dfn>

<dd> Misattribution occurs when data or communications related to one individual
    are attributed to another. See <a
data-cite="RFC6973#section-5.1.4">RFC6973§5.1.4</a>.

<dt><dfn>Correlation</dfn>

<dd> Correlation is the combination of various pieces of information related to an
    individual or that obtain that characteristic when combined. See
    <a
data-cite="RFC6973#section-5.2.1">RFC6973§5.2.1</a>.

<dt><dfn>Identification</dfn>

<dd> Identification is the linking of information to a particular individual to
    infer an individual’s identity or to allow the inference of an individual’s
    identity. See <a
data-cite="RFC6973#section-5.2.2">RFC6973§5.2.2</a>.

<dt><dfn>Secondary Use</dfn>

<dd> Secondary use is the use of collected information about an individual without
    the individual’s consent for a purpose different from that for which the
    information was collected. See <a
data-cite="RFC6973#section-5.2.3">RFC6973§5.2.3</a>.

<dt><dfn>Disclosure</dfn>

<dd>Disclosure is the revelation of information about an individual that affects

data-cite="RFC6973#section-5.2.5">RFC6973§5.2.5</a>.

</dl>

These threats combine into the particular concrete threats we want web
specifications to defend against, described in subsections here:

## Unwanted same-site recognition {#hl-recognition-same-site}

Contributes to [=surveillance=], [=correlation=], and [=identification=].

Users of most instantiations of the web platform expect that if they visit a
site on one day, and then visit again the next day, the site will be able to
recognize that they're the same user. This allows sites to save the user's
preferences, shopping carts, etc. The web platform offers many mechanisms that
are either intended to accomplish this recognition or that can be trivially used
for it, including [[RFC6265|cookies]], {{WindowLocalStorage/localStorage}},
{{WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/indexedDB}}, {{CacheStorage}}, and other forms of
storage.

A privacy harm only occurs if the user wants to break the association between
two visits, but the site can still determine with high probability that the two
visits came from the same user.

A user might expect that their two visits won't be associated if they:

* Use a browser that promises to avoid such correlation.
* Use their browser's private browsing mode. ([[WHAT-DOES-PRIVATE-BROWSING-DO]])
* Use two different browser profiles between the two visits.
* Explicitly clear the site's cookies or storage.

This recognition is generally accomplished by either "supercookies" or <a
data-cite="fingerprinting-guidance#dfn-browser-fingerprinting">browser
fingerprinting</a>.

Supercookies occur when a browser stores data for a site but makes that data
more difficult to clear than other cookies or storage.
<a data-cite="fingerprinting-guidance#clearing-all-local-state">Fingerprinting
Guidance § Clearing all local state</a> discusses how specifications can help
browsers avoid this mistake.

Fingerprinting consists of using attributes of the user's browser and platform
that are consistent between the two visits and probabilistically unique to the
user.

The attributes can be exposed as information about the user's device that is
otherwise benign (as opposed to [[[#hl-sensitive-information]]]). For example:

* What are the user's language and time zone?
* What size is the user's window?
* What system preferences has the user set? Dark mode, serif font, etc...
* ...

See [[fingerprinting-guidance]] for how to mitigate this threat.

## Unwanted cross-site recognition {#hl-recognition-cross-site}

Contributes to [=surveillance=], [=correlation=], and [=identification=],
usually more significantly than [[[#hl-recognition-same-site]]].

This occurs if a site can determine with high probability that a visit to that
site comes from the same user as another visit to a *different* site.

## Sensitive information disclosure {#hl-sensitive-information}

Contributes to [=correlation=], [=identification=], [=secondary use=], and
[=disclosure=].

Many pieces of information about a user could cause privacy harms if disclosed.
For example:

* The user's location.
* Video or audio from the user's camera or microphone.
* The content of certain files on the user's filesystem.
* Financial data.
* Contacts.
* Calendar entries.
* [Whether the user is using assistive technology.](https://w3ctag.github.io/design-principles/#do-not-expose-use-of-assistive-tech)
* ...

A particular piece of information may have different sensitivity for different
users. Language preferences, for example, might typically seem innocent, but
also can be an indicator of belonging to an ethnic minority. Precise location
information can be extremely sensitive (because it's identifying, because it
allows for in-person intrusions, because it can reveal detailed information
about a person's life) but it might also be public and not sensitive at all, or
it might be low-enough granularity that it is much less sensitive for many
users.

When considering whether a class of information is likely to be sensitive to
users, consider at least these factors:

* whether it serves as a persistent identifier (see severity in Mitigating
    browser fingerprinting);
* whether it discloses substantial (including intimate details or inferences)
    information about the user or other users;
* whether it can be revoked (as in determining whether a permission is
    necessary);
* whether it enables other threats, like intrusion.

Issue(16): This description of what makes information sensitive still needs to
be refined.

## Intrusive behavior {#hl-intrusion}

See [=intrusion=].

Privacy harms don't always come from a site learning things. For example it is
intrusive for a site to

* Display messages or notifications,
* Play sounds,
* Occupy the full screen,
* etc.

if the user doesn't intend for it to do so.

## Powerful capabilities {#hl-capabilities}

Contributes to [=misattribution=].

For example, a site that sends SMS without the user's intent could cause them to
be blamed for things they didn't intend.
