Privacy is an essential part of the Web ([[?ETHICAL-WEB]]). This document provides definitions
for privacy and related concepts that are applicable worldwide. It also provides a set of privacy
principles that should guide the development of the Web as a trustworthy platform. People using
the Web would benefit from a stronger relationship between technology and policy, and this
document is written to work with both.

</section>

<section id="sotd">

This document is a Draft Finding of the [Technical Architecture Group (TAG)](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/).
It was prepared by the [Web Privacy Principles Task Force](https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles),
which was convened by the TAG. Publication as a Draft Finding does not imply endorsement by the TAG
or by the W3C Membership.

This draft <strong>does not yet</strong> reflect the consensus of the TAG or the task force and may
be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to cite this
document as anything other than a work in progress.

It will continue to evolve and the task force will issue updates as often as needed. At the
conclusion of the task force, the TAG intends to adopt this document as a Finding.

<aside class="note">

Privacy is covered by legal frameworks and this document recognises that existing data
protection laws take precedence for legal matters. However, because the Web is global, we
benefit from having shared concepts to guide its evolution as a system built for the people using it
([[?RFC8890]]). A clear and well-defined view of privacy on the Web, informed by research,
can hopefully help all the Web's participants in different legal regimes. Our shared
understanding is that the law is a floor, not a ceiling.

# An Introduction to Privacy on the Web {#intro}

The Web is for everyone ([[?For-Everyone]]). It is "a platform that helps people and provides a
net positive social benefit" ([[?ETHICAL-WEB]], [[?design-principles]]). One of the ways in which the
Web serves people is by protecting them in the face of asymmetries of power and this includes
establishing and enforcing rules to govern the power of data.

The Web is a social and technical system made up of [=information flows=]. Because this document
is specifically about [=privacy=] as it applies to the Web, it focuses on privacy around
information flows. Our goal is not to boil the privacy ocean, but rather to provide enough
background to support the Web community in making informed decisions about privacy and to weave
privacy into the architecture of the Web. Few architectural principles are absolute, and privacy is
no exception: privacy can come into tension with other desirable properties of an ethical
architecture, and when that happens the Web community will have to work together to strike the right
balance.

Information is power. It can be used to predict and to influence people, as well as to design online
spaces that control people's behaviour. The collection and [=processing=] of information in greater
volume, with greater precision and reliability, with increasing interoperability across a growing
variety of data types, and at intensifying speed is leading to an unprecedented concentration of power
that threatens private and public liberties.

What's more, automation and the increasing computerisation of all aspects of our lives
both increase the power of information and decrease the cost of a number of intrusive
behaviours that would be more easily kept in check if the perpetrator had to be in the same room as
the victim.

These asymmetries of information and of automation create commanding asymmetries of power. It is not
so much that <q>code is law</q>  but rather that code is judge, jury, and executioner.

<dfn data-lt="governance">Data governance</dfn> is the system of [=principles=] that regulate [=information flows=]. When
[=people=] are involved in these [=information flows=], [=data governance=] determines how
these [=principles=] constrain and distribute the power of information between different [=actors=].
The <dfn>principles</dfn> describe the way in which different [=actors=] may, must,
or must not produce or [=process=] flows of information from, to, or about other [=actors=]
([[?GKC-Privacy]], [[?IAD]]).

Typically, <dfn>actors</dfn> are [=people=] but they can also be collective endeavours such as
companies, associations, or political parties (eg. in the case of espionage), which are known as
[=parties=]. It is important to keep in mind that not all people are equal in how they can resist
the imposition of unfair [=principles=]: some [=people=] are more [=vulnerable=] and therefore in greater
need of protection. The focus of this document is on the impact that this power differential can
have against people, but it can also impact other entities, such as companies or governments.

[=Principles=] vary from [=context=] to [=context=] ([[?Understanding-Privacy]], [[?Contextual-Integrity]]): people
have different expectations of [=privacy=] at work, at a café, or at home for instance. Understanding and
evaluating a privacy situation is best done by clearly identifying:

* Its [=actors=], which include the subject of the information as well as the sender and the recipient
  of the [=information flow=]. (Note that recipients might not always intend to be recipients.)
* The specific type of data in the [=information flow=].
* The [=principles=] that are in use in this specific context.

It is important to keep in mind that there are <em>always</em> privacy [=principles=] and that all
of them imply different power dynamics. Some [=principles=] may be more permissive, but that does
not render them neutral — it merely indicates that they are supportive of the power dynamic that
they help to create. We must therefore determine which [=principles=]
best align with ethical Web values in Web [=contexts=] ([[?ETHICAL-WEB]], [[?Why-Privacy]]).

<dfn data-lt='information'>Information flows</dfn> as understood in this document are information
exchanged or processed by [=actors=]. The information itself need not necessarily be
[=personal data=]. Disruptive or interruptive information flowing <em>to</em> a
person is in scope, as is [=de-identified=] [=data=] that can be used to manipulate people or that
was extracted by observing people's behaviour on someone else's website.

[=Information flows=] need to be understood from more than one perspective: there is the flow of information
<em>about</em> a person (the subject) being processed or transmitted to any other party, and there is
the flow of information <em>towards</em> a person (the recipient). Recipients can have their privacy violated in multiple ways such as
unexpected shocking images, loud noises while one intends to sleep, manipulative information,
interruptive messages when a person's focus is on something else, or harassment when they seek
social interactions.

## Individual Autonomy {#autonomy}

A [=person=]'s <dfn data-lt="autonomous">autonomy</dfn> is their ability to make decisions of their own volition,
without undue influence from other parties. People have limited intellectual resources and
time with which to weigh decisions, and by necessity rely on shortcuts when making
decisions. This makes their preferences, including privacy preferences, malleable and susceptible to
manipulation ([[?Privacy-Behavior]], [[?Digital-Market-Manipulation]]). A [=person=]'s [=autonomy=] is enhanced by a
system or device when that system offers a shortcut that aligns more with what that [=person=] would
have decided given arbitrary amounts of time and relatively unlimited intellectual ability;
and [=autonomy=] is decreased when a similar shortcut goes against decisions made under such
ideal conditions.

Affordances and interactions that decrease [=autonomy=] are known as <dfn>dark patterns</dfn>.
A [=dark pattern=] does not have to be intentional. ([[?Dark-Patterns]], [[?Dark-Pattern-Dark]])

Because we are all subject to motivated reasoning, the design of defaults and affordances
that may impact [=autonomy=] should be the subject of independent scrutiny.

Given the large volume of potential [=data=]-related decisions in today's data economy,
complete informational self-determination is impossible. This fact, however, should not be
confused with the idea that privacy is dead. Careful design of our technological
infrastructure can ensure that people's [=autonomy=] with respect to pertaining to their own [=data=]
is enhanced through [=appropriate=] defaults and choice architectures.

### Opt-in, Consent, Opt-out, Global Controls {#opt-in-out}

<aside class="issue">Broaden this from [=processing=] to general interactions with systems.</aside>

Different procedural mechanisms exist to enable [=people=] to control how they interact
with systems in the world. Mechanisms that increase the number of [=purposes=] for which
their [=data=] is being [=processed=] are referred to as [=opt-in=] or
<dfn data-lt="opt in|opt-in">consent</dfn>; mechanisms that decrease this number of [=purposes=] are known as
<dfn data-lt="opt out">opt-out</dfn>.

When deployed thoughtfully, these mechanisms can enhance [=people=]'s [=autonomy=]. Often,
however, they are used as a way to avoid putting in the difficult work of deciding which
types of [=processing=] are [=appropriate=] and which are not, offloading [=privacy labour=]
to the people using a system.

In rare and highly specific cases, [=people=] should be able to [=consent=] to more
sensitive [=purposes=], such as having their [=identity=] recognised across contexts or
their reading history shared with a company. The burden of proof on ensuring that informed
[=consent=] has been obtained needs in this case to be very high (much higher than what prevails for
instance in [[?GDPR]] jurisdictions as currently practiced). [=Consent=] is comparable to the
general problem of permissions on the Web platform. In the same way that it should be clear when a
given device capability is in use (eg. you are providing geolocation or camera access), sharing
data should be set up in such a way that it requires deliberate, specific action from the [=person=]
(eg. triggering a form control that is not on a modal dialog) and if that [=consent=] is persistent,
there should be a vivid indicator that data is being transmitted shown at all times, in such a way
that the person can easily switch it off. In general, providing [=consent=] should be rare,
difficult, highly intentional, and temporary.

When an [=opt-out=] mechanism exists, it should preferably be complemented by a
<dfn>global opt-out</dfn> mechanism. The function of a [=global opt-out=] mechanism is to
rectify the <dfn class="export">automation asymmetry</dfn> whereby service providers can automate
[=data processing=] but [=people=] have to take manual action. A good example of a
[=global opt-out=] mechanism is the <em>Global Privacy Control</em> [[?GPC]].

Conceptually, a [=global opt-out=] mechanism is an automaton operating as part of the
[=user agent=], which is to say that it is equivalent to a robot that would carry out a
[=person=]'s bidding by pressing an [=opt-out=] button with every interaction that the
[=person=] has with a site, or more generally conveys an expression of the [=person=]'s
rights in a relevant jurisdiction. (For instance, under [[?GDPR]], the [=person=] may be
conveying objections to [=processing=] based on legitimate interest or the withdrawal of
[=consent=] to specific [=purposes=].) It should be noted that, since a [=global opt-out=]
signal is reaffirmed automatically with every interaction, it will take precedence
in terms of specificity over any manner of blanket [=consent=] that a site may obtain,
unless that [=consent=] is directly attached to an interaction (eg. terms specified on a
form upon submission).

### Privacy Labour {#privacy-labour}

<dfn data-lt="privacy labor">Privacy labour</dfn> is the practice of having a [=person=] carry out
the work of ensuring [=data processing=] of which they are the subject or recipient is
[=appropriate=], instead of having the [=parties=] be responsible for that work.
Data systems that are based on asking [=people=] for their [=consent=] tend to increase
[=privacy labour=].

More generally, implementations of [=privacy=] are often dominated by self-governing approaches that
offload labour to [=people=]. This is notably true of the regimes descended from the
<dfn data-lt="FIPs">Fair Information Practices</dfn> ([=FIPs=]), a loose set of principles initially
elaborated in the 1970s in support of individual [=autonomy=] in the face of growing concerns with databases. The
[=FIPs=] generally assume that there is sufficiently little [=data processing=] taking place that any
[=person=] will be able to carry out sufficient diligence to enable [=autonomy=] in their
decision-making. Since they entirely offload the [=privacy labour=]
to people and assume perfect, unlimited [=autonomy=], the [=FIPs=] do not forbid specific
types of [=data processing=] but only place them under different procedural requirements.
Such an approach is [=appropriate=] for [=parties=] that are processing data in the 1970s.

One notable issue with procedural, self-governing approaches to privacy is that they tend to have the same
requirements in situations where people find themselves in a significant asymmetry of
power with a [=party=] — for instance a [=person=] using an essential service provided by a
monopolistic platform — and those where people and [=parties=] are very much on equal
footing, or even where the [=person=] may have greater power, as is the case with small
businesses operating in a competitive environment. It further does not consider cases in
which one [=party=] may coerce other [=parties=] into facilitating its [=inappropriate=]
practices, as is often the case with dominant players in advertising or
in content aggregation ([[?Consent-Lackeys]], [[?CAT]]).

Reference to the [=FIPs=] survives to this day. They are often referenced as <em>transparency
and choice</em>, which, in today's digital environment, is often an indication that
[=inappropriate=] [=processing=] is being described.



## Collective Governance {#collective}

Privacy [=principles=] are socially negotiated and the definition of [=privacy=] is essentially
contested ([[?Privacy-Contested]]). This makes privacy a problem of collective action ([[?GKC-Privacy]]).
Population-level [=data processing=] may impact populations or individuals, including in
ways that [=people=] could not control even under the optimistic assumptions of [=consent=].
For example, based on population-level analysis, a company may know that <var>site.example</var>
is predominantly visited by [=people=] of a given race or gender, and decide not to run its
job ads there. Visitors to that page are implicitly having their [=data=] processed in
[=inappropriate=] ways, with no way to discover the discrimination or seek relief
([[?Relational-Governance]]).

What we consider is therefore not just the relation between the [=people=] who share data
and the [=parties=] that invite that disclosure ([[?Relational-Turn]]), but also between the [=people=]
who may find themselves categorised indirectly even without sharing data. One key understanding here
is that such relations may persist even when data is [=de-identified=]. What's more, such
categorisation of people, voluntary or not, changes the way in which the world operates.
This can produce self-reinforcing loops that can damage both individuals and
groups ([[?Seeing-Like-A-State]]).

In general, collective issues in [=data=] require collective solutions. Web standards help with
[=data governance=] by defining structural controls
in [=user agents=] and establishing or delegating to institutions that can handle issues of [=privacy=].
[=Governance=] will often struggle to achieve its goals if it works primarily by
increasing <em>individual</em> control instead of acting collectively.

Collecting data at large scales can have significant pro-social outcomes. Problems tend to
emerge when entities [=process=] [=data=]
for collective benefit and for [=self-dealing=] [=purposes=] at the same time.
The [=self-dealing=] [=purposes=] are often justified as bankrolling the pro-social outcomes
but this requires collective oversight to be [=appropriate=].

### Transparency and Research {#transparency}

While transparency rarely helps enough to inform the individual choices that [=people=] may
make or in increasing their [=autonomy=], it plays a critical role in letting
researchers and reporters inform our
collective decision-making about to privacy [=principles=]. This consideration extends the
TAG's resolution on a [Strong and Secure Web Platform](https://www.w3.org/blog/2015/11/strong-web-platform-statement/)
to ensure that <q>broad testing and audit continues to be possible</q> where
[=information flows=] and automated decisions are involved.

Such transparency can only function if there are strong rights of access to data (including data
derived from one's personal data) as well as mechanisms to explain the outcomes of automated
decisions.

## People's Agents {#user-agents}

The <dfn>user agent</dfn> acts as an intermediary between a [=person=] (its [=user=]) and the web.
[=User agents=] implement, to the extent possible, the [=principles=] that collective governance
establishes in favour of individuals. They seek to prevent the creation of asymmetries of
information, and serve their [=user=] by providing them with automation, to rectify
[=automation asymmetries=]. Where possible, they protect their [=user=] from receiving
intrusive messages.

The [=user agent=] is expected to align fully with the [=person=] using it and operate exclusively
in that [=person=]'s interest. It is <em>not</em> the [=first party=]. The [=user agent=] serves the
[=person=] as a <dfn>trustworthy agent</dfn>:
it always puts that [=person=]'s interest first. In some occasions, this can mean protecting
that [=person=] from themselves by preventing them from carrying out a dangerous decision,
or by slowing down the person in their decision. For example, the
[=user agent=] will make it difficult for that [=person=] to connect to a site if it can't verify
that the site is authentic. It will check that that [=person=] really intends to expose a
sensitive device to a page. It will prevent that [=person=] from consenting to the permanent
monitoring of their behaviour. Its <dfn class="export">user agent duties</dfn> include
([[?Taking-Trust-Seriously]]):

<dl>
  <dt><dfn class="export">Duty of Protection</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
    Protection requires [=user agents=] to actively protect their [=user=]'s data, beyond
    simple security measures. It is insufficient to just encrypt at rest and in transit,
    but the [=user agent=] must also limit retention, help ensure that only strictly
    necessary data is collected, and require guarantees from any [=party=] that the user agent can
    reasonably be aware that it is shared to.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn class="export">Duty of Discretion</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
    Discretion requires the [=user agent=] to make best efforts to enforce
    [=principles=] by taking care in the ways it discloses the [=personal data=]
    that it manages. Discretion is not
    confidentiality or secrecy: trust
    can be preserved even when the [=user agent=] shares some [=personal data=], so long as
    it is done in an [=appropriately=] discreet manner.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn class="export">Duty of Honesty</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
    Honesty requires that the [=user agent=] try to give its [=user=]
    information of which the [=user agent=] can reasonably be aware, that is relevant to
    them and that will increase their
    autonomy, as long as they can understand it and there's an appropriate
    time. This is almost never when the [=person=] is trying to do something else such as
    read a page or activate a feature. The duty of honesty goes well beyond that of
    transparency that is often included in older privacy regimes. Unlike transparency, honesty
    can't hide relevant information in complex legal notices and it can't rely on
    very short summaries provided in a consent dialog.
    If the person has provided [=consent=] to [=processing=] of their [=personal data=],
    the [=user agent=] should inform the [=person=] of ongoing [=processing=], with a
    level of obviousness that is proportional to the reasonably foreseeable impact of the processing.
  </dd>
  <dt><dfn class="export">Duty of Loyalty</dfn></dt>
  <dd>
    Because the [=user agent=] is a [=trustworthy agent=], it is held to be loyal to the
    [=person=] using it in all situations, including in preference to the [=user agent=]'s implementer.
    When a [=user agent=] carries out [=processing=] that is not in the [=person=]'s
    interest but instead benefits another entity (such as the user agent's implementer) that behaviour is
    known as <dfn>self-dealing</dfn>. Behaviour can be [=self-dealing=] even if it is done at the
    same time as [=processing=] that is in the [=person=]'s interest, what matters is that it
    potentially conflicts with that [=person=]'s interest. [=Self-dealing=] is always
    [=inappropriate=]. Loyalty is the avoidance of [=self-dealing=].
  </dd>
</dl>

These duties ensure the [=user agent=] will <em>care</em> for its [=user=]. In academic
research, this relationship with a [=trustworthy agent=] is often described as "fiduciary"
[[?Fiduciary-UA]]. Some jurisdictions may have a distinct legal meaning for "fiduciary".

Many of the [=principles=] described in the rest of this document extend the [=user agent=]'s duties and
make them more precise.




# Principles for Privacy on the Web

As indicated above, different [=contexts=] require different [=principles=]. This section describes a set
of [=principles=] designed to apply to the Web [=context=] in general. The Web is a big place, and we
fully expect more specific [=contexts=] of the Web to add their own [=principles=] to further constrain
[=information flows=].

To the extent possible, [=user agents=] are expected to enforce these [=principles=]. However, this is not
always possible and additional enforcement mechanisms are needed. One particularly salient issue
is that a [=context=] is not defined in terms of who owns it (it is not a [=party=]). Sharing
[=data=] between different [=contexts=] of a single company is just as much a [=privacy violation=] as
if the same data were shared between unrelated [=parties=].

## Principles for Identity on the Web {#identity}

<aside class="issue">
  This section has not been edited for narrative.
</aside>

A [=person=]'s <dfn>identity</dfn> is the set of characteristics that define them. Their identity
*in a [=context=]* is the set of characteristics they present to that context. People
frequently present different identities to different contexts, and also frequently share an identity
among several contexts.

<dfn>Cross-context recognition</dfn> is the act of recognising that an [=identity=] in one
[=context=] is the same [=person=] as an [=identity=] in another [=context=]. [=Cross-context
recognition=] can at times be [=appropriate=] but anyone who does it needs to be careful not to
apply the [=principles=] of one [=context=] in ways that violate the [=principles=] around use of information
acquired in a different [=context=]. (For example, if you meet your therapist at a cocktail party,
you expect them to have rather different discussion topics with you than they usually would, and
possibly even to pretend they do not know you.) This is particularly true for [=vulnerable=] people
as recognising them in different [=contexts=] may force their vulnerability into the open.

In computer systems and on the Web, an [=identity=] seen by a particular website is typically
assigned an <dfn>identifier</dfn> of some type, which makes it easier for an automated system to
store data about that [=person=]. Examples of [=identifiers=] for a [=person=] can be:
* their name,
* an identification number including those mapping to a device that this [=person=] may be using,
* their phone number,
* their location data,
* an online identifier such as email or IP addresses, or
* factors specific to their physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social
[=identity=].

Strings derived from [=identifiers=], for instance through hashing, are still
[=identifiers=] so long as they may identify a [=person=].

<div class="practice">

<span class="practicelab" id="principle-identity-per-context">[=User agents=] should support
their [=users=]' [=autonomy=] by helping them present their intended [=identity=] to each
[=context=] that they visit.</span>

</div>

To do this, [=user agents=] have to make some assumptions about the borders between [=contexts=]. By
default, [=user agents=] define a <dfn>machine-enforceable context</dfn> or <dfn>partition</dfn> as:

* A set of [=environments=] (roughly iframes (including cross-site iframes), workers, and top-level
  pages)
* whose [=environment/top-level origins=] are in the [=same site=] (but see [[PSL-Problems]])
* being visited within the same user agent installation (and browser profile, container, or
  container tab for user agents that support those features)
* between points in time that the person or user agent clears that [=site=]'s cookies and other
  storage (which is sometimes automatic at the end of each session).

Even though this is the default, [=user agents=] are free to restrict this context as
people need. For example, some user agents may help people present different
[=identities=] to subdivisions of a single [=site=].

<div class="issue" data-number="1">

There is disagreement about whether [=user agents=] may also widen their [=machine-enforceable
contexts=]. For example, some user agents might want to help their users present a single
[=identity=] to multiple [=sites=] that the user understands represent a single [=party=], or to a
[=site=] across multiple installations.

</div>

[=User agents=] should prevent people from being [=cross-context recognition|recognized=] across
[=machine-enforceable contexts=] unless they intend to be recognized. This is a "should" rather
than a "must" because there are many cases where the user agent isn't powerful enough to prevent
recognition. For example if two or more services that a person needs to use insist that they share
a difficult-to-forge piece of their identity in order to use the services, it's the services
behaving [=inappropriately=] rather than the [=user agent=].

If a [=site=] includes multiple [=contexts=] whose [=principles=] indicate that it's [=inappropriate=] to
share data between the contexts, the fact that those distinct [=contexts=] fall inside a single
[=machine-enforceable context=] doesn't make sharing data or [=cross-context
recognition|recognizing=] [=identities=] any less [=inappropriate=].

### Unwanted cross-context recognition {#hl-recognition-cross-context}

<aside class="issue">Merge this into its parent section on identity.</aside>

Contributes to [=surveillance=], [=correlation=], and [=identification=].

As described in [[[#identity]]], [=cross-context recognition=] can sometimes be [=appropriate=], but
users need to be able to control when websites do it as much as possible.

<div class="practice">

<p><span class="practicelab" id="principle-prevent-cross-partition-recognition">[=User agents=]
should ensure that, if a [=person=] visits two or more web pages from different [=partitions=], that
the pages cannot quickly determine that the visits probably came from the same person, for any
significant or involuntary fraction of the people who use the web, unless the person explicitly
expresses the same [=identity=] to the visits, or preventing this correlation would break a
technical feature that is fundamental to the Web.</span></p>

</div>

* This principle uses "probably" because websites can do harm even if they can't be completely
  certain that visits come from the same person.
* This principle uses "quickly" because it currently appears impossible to prevent some forms of
  fingerprinting that take a long time or many visits within each [=partition=].
* This principle is limited in cases that only affect a small fraction of people who use the web
  because people may configure their systems in unique ways, for example by using
  a browser with a very small number of users. As long as a tracker can't track a significant number
  of people, it's likely to be unviable to maintain the tracker. However, this doesn't excuse making
  small groups of people trackable when those people didn't choose to be in the group.
* This principle is also limited in cases where preventing recognition would break fundamental
  aspects of the web. In many cases it's possible to change the design in a way that avoids the
  violation without breaking valid use cases, but for cases where that's not possible this document
  delegates to other documents, for example the [[[Privacy-Threat]]], to discuss what detailed
  tradeoffs to make.
* This principle may not be able to be applied in situations where a [=person=] has shared [=identity=]
  information in a medium that is not accessible to the [=user agent=].

[=Partitions=] are separated in two ways that lead to distinct kinds of user-visible recognition.
When their divisions between different sites are violated, that leads to <a
href="#hl-recognition-cross-site"></a>. When a violation occurs at their other divisions, for
example between different browser profiles or at the point someone clears their cookies and site
storage, that leads to <a href="#hl-recognition-same-site"></a>.

#### Same-site recognition {#hl-recognition-same-site}

The web platform offers many ways for a website to recognize that a [=person=] is using the same
[=identity=] over time, including [[RFC6265|cookies]], {{WindowLocalStorage/localStorage}},
{{WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/indexedDB}}, {{CacheStorage}}, and other forms of storage. This allows
sites to save the [=person=]'s preferences, shopping carts, etc., and people have come to expect this
behavior in some contexts.

A privacy harm occurs if a [=person=] reasonably expects that they'll be using a different [=identity=]
on a site, but the site discovers and uses the fact that the two or more visits probably came from
the same [=person=] anyway.

[=User agents=] can't, in general, determine exactly where intra-site [=context=] boundaries are, or
how a site allows a [=person=] to express that they intend to change [=identities=], so they're not
responsible to enforce that sites actually separate [=identities=] at those boundaries. The <a
href="#principle-prevent-cross-partition-recognition">principle</a> here instead requires separation
at [=partition=] boundaries.

Cross-[=partition=] recognition is generally accomplished by either "supercookies" or <a>browser
fingerprinting</a>.

Supercookies occur when a browser stores data for a site but makes that data
more difficult to clear than other cookies or storage.
<a data-cite="fingerprinting-guidance#clearing-all-local-state">Fingerprinting
Guidance § Clearing all local state</a> discusses how specifications can help
browsers avoid this mistake.

Fingerprinting consists of using attributes of the [=person=]'s browser and platform
that are consistent between two or more visits and probably unique to the
person.

The attributes can be exposed as information about the [=person=]'s device that is
otherwise benign (as opposed to [[[#hl-sensitive-information]]]). For example:

* What are the person's language and time zone?
* What size is the window?
* What system preferences have been set? Dark mode, serif font, etc...
* ...

See [[fingerprinting-guidance]] for how to mitigate this threat.

#### Unwanted cross-site recognition {#hl-recognition-cross-site}

A privacy harm occurs if a site determines with high probability and uses the fact that a visit to
that site comes from the same person as another visit to a *different* site, unless the person could
reasonably expect the sites to discover this. Traditionally, sites have accomplished this using <a
href="https://tess.oconnor.cx/2020/10/parties#environment-cross-site">cross-site</a> cookies, but it
can also be done by having someone navigate to a link that has been decorated with an identifier,
collecting the same piece of identifying information on both sites, or by correlating the timestamps
of an event that occurs nearly-simultaneously on both sites.


## Principles for Personal Data {#data}

<aside class="issue">
  This section has not been edited for narrative.
</aside>

We define <dfn data-lt="data">personal data</dfn> as any information that is directly or
indirectly related to an identified or identifiable [=person=], such as by reference to an
[=identifier=] ([[GDPR]], [[OECD-Guidelines]], [[Convention-108]]).

If a [=person=] could reasonably be identified or re-identified when [=data=] is combined with other
[=data=], then that makes that data [=personal data=].

### Data users and use {#data-users}

A <dfn data-lt="data processor">service provider</dfn> or [=data processor=] is considered to be the same
[=party=] as the entity contracting it to perform the relevant [=processing=] if it:

* is processing the data on behalf of that [=party=];
* ensures that the data is only retained, accessed, and used as directed by that
  [=party=] and solely for the list of explicitly-specified [=purposes=]
  detailed by the directing [=party=] or [=data controller=];
* may determine implementation details of the data processing in question but
  does not determine the [=purpose=] for which the data is being [=processed=]
  nor the overarching [=means=] through which the [=purpose=] is carried out;
* has no independent right to use the data other than in a [=de-identified=] form (e.g., for
  monitoring service integrity, load balancing, capacity planning, or billing); and,
* has a contract in place with the [=party=] which is consistent with the above limitations.

A <dfn>data controller</dfn> is a [=party=] that determines the [=means=] and [=purposes=]
of data processing. Any [=party=] that is not a [=service provider=] is a [=data controller=].

### Techniques {#data-techniques}

The <dfn>Vegas Rule</dfn> is a simple implementation of privacy in which <q>what happens with the
[=first party=] stays with the [=first party=]</q>. Put differently, the [=Vegas Rule=] is followed
when the [=first party=] is the only [=data controller=]. While the [=Vegas Rule=] is a good
guideline, it's neither necessary nor sufficient for [=appropriate=] [=data processing=]. A [=first
party=] that maintains exclusive access to a person's data can still [=process=] it
[=inappropriately=], and there are cases where a third party can learn information about a person
but still treat it [=appropriately=].

#### De-identification

Data is <dfn>de-identified</dfn> when there exists a high level of confidence
that no [=person=] described by the data can be identified, directly or indirectly
(e.g. via association with an [=identifier=], user agent, or device), by that data alone or in
combination with other available information. Note
that further considerations relating to groups are covered in the
<a href="#collective">Collective Issues in Privacy</a> section.

We talk of <dfn>controlled de-identified data</dfn> when there are strict controls that prevent the
re-identification of [=people=] described by the data except for a well-defined set of [=purposes=].

Different situations involving [=controlled de-identified data=] will require different controls. For instance,
if the [=controlled de-identified data=] is <em>only</em> being processed by one [=party=], typical controls
include making sure that the [=identifiers=] used in the data are unique to that dataset, that
any person (e.g. an employee of the [=party=]) with access to the [=data=] is barred (e.g. based on
legal terms) from sharing the [=data=] further, and that technical measures exist to prevent
re-identification or the joining of different data sets involving this [=data=], notably against
timing or k-anonymity attacks.

In general, the goal is to ensure that [=controlled de-identified data=] is used in a manner that provides a
viable degree of oversight and accountability such that technical and procedural means to guarantee
the maintenance of pseudonymity are preserved.

This is more difficult when the [=controlled de-identified data=] is shared between several [=parties=]. In such
cases, good examples of typical controls that are representative of best practices would include
making sure that:

* the [=identifiers=] used in the [=data=] are under the direct and exclusive control of
  the [=first party=] who is prevented by strict controls from matching the identifiers with the
  data;

* when these [=identifiers=] are shared with a [=third party=], they are made unique
  to that [=third party=] such that if they are shared with more than one
  [=third party=] these cannot then match them up with one another;

* there is a strong level of confidence that no [=third party=] can match the [=data=]
  with any data other than that obtained through interactions with the [=first
  party=];

* any [=third party=] receiving such [=data=] is barred (eg. based on legal terms)
  from sharing it further;

* technical measures exist to prevent re-identification or the joining of
  different data sets involving this [=data=], notably against timing or
  k-anonymity attacks; and

* there exist contractual terms between the [=first party=] and [=third party=]
  describing the limited [=purpose=] for which the data is being shared.

Note that [=controlled de-identified data=], on its own, is not sufficient to render [=data processing=]
[=appropriate=].

### Rights {#data-rights}

To the extent possible, [=people=] should retain a certain number of rights over their data, and
these rights should be facilitated by the [=parties=]. While data rights are a self-governing
mechanism that is not sufficient to support [=privacy=], they do complement self-determination and
help improve accountability. Such rights should include:

* The right to <em>access</em> [=data=] about oneself.
* The right to <em>erase</em> [=data=] about oneself, with or without terminating the service (though
  what [=data=] can be erased may differ between those two cases).
* The right to <em>port</em> information that one has stored with a given [=party=] in such a way
  that it can easily be reused or transferred elsewhere.
* The right to <em>correct</em> [=data=] about oneself, to ensure that one's [=identity=] is
  properly reflected in a system.

## Principles for Sensitive Information {#hl-sensitive-information}

Contributes to [=correlation=], [=identification=], [=secondary use=], and
[=disclosure=].

Many pieces of information about someone could cause privacy harms if disclosed.
For example:

* Their location.
* Video or audio from the their camera or microphone.
* The content of certain files on their filesystem.
* Financial data.
* Contacts.
* Calendar entries.
* [Whether they are using assistive technology.](https://w3ctag.github.io/design-principles/#do-not-expose-use-of-assistive-tech)
* ...

A particular piece of information may have different sensitivity for different
people. Language preferences, for example, might typically seem innocent, but
also can be an indicator of belonging to an ethnic minority. Precise location
information can be extremely sensitive (because it's identifying, because it
allows for in-person intrusions, because it can reveal detailed information
about a person's life) but it might also be public and not sensitive at all, or
it might be low-enough granularity that it is much less sensitive for many
people.

When considering whether a class of information is likely to be sensitive to
a person, consider at least these factors:

* whether it serves as a persistent [=identifier=] (see severity in Mitigating
    browser fingerprinting);
* whether it discloses substantial (including intimate details or inferences)
    information about the the person using the system or other people;
* whether it can be revoked (as in determining whether a permission is
    necessary);
* whether it enables other threats, like intrusion.

Issue(16): This description of what makes information sensitive still needs to
be refined.

## Principles for Profiling {#hl-unexpected-profiling}

<aside class="issue">
  This section has not been edited for narrative.
</aside>

Contributes to [=surveillance=], [=correlation=], [=identification=], and
singling-out / discrimination.

Unexpected profiling occurs when a site is able to learn attributes or
characteristics about a person, that a) the site visitor did not intend the site
to learn, and b) the site visitor reasonably could not anticipate a
site would be able to learn.

Profiling contributes to, but is distinct from, other privacy risks discussed
in this document.
For example, unexpected profiling may contribute to
[[[#hl-recognition-same-site]]], by adding stable and semi-identifying
information that can contribute to <a
data-cite="fingerprinting-guidance#dfn-browser-fingerprinting">browser
fingerprinting</a>. Unexpected profiling is distinct from same-site
recognition though, in that a person may wish to not share some kinds
of information about themselves <em>even in the presence of guarantees
that such information will not lead to them being re-identified</em>.

Similarly, unexpected profiling is related to [[[#hl-sensitive-information]]],
but the former is a superset of the latter;
all cases of unexpected sensitive information disclosure are examples of
unexpected profiling, but people using the Web may have attributes or characteristics
about themselves that are not universally thought of as "sensitive", but which
they never the less do not wish to share with the sites they visit. People
may wish to not share these "non-sensitive" characteristics
for a variety of reasons (e.g., a person may worry that their ideas of what
counts as "sensitive" is different from others, a person might might be ashamed
or uncomfortable about a character trait or they might simply not wish to be profiled).

Profiling occurs for many reasons. It can be used to facilitate price
discrimination or offer manipulation, to make inferences about what products or
services people might be more likely to purchase, or more generally, for a site
to learn attributes about them that they do not intend to share.
Unexpected profiling can also contribute to feelings of powerlessness and
loss of agency [[?Privacy-Concerned]].

A privacy harm occurs if a site learns information about a person that they
reasonably expected the site would not be able to learn, regardless of
whether that information aids (re)identification or is from a sensitive category
of information (however defined).

<div class="example">

Peter is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furry_fandom">furry</a>.
Despite knowing that there are thousands of
other furries on the internet, and despite using a browser with
robust browser fingerprinting protections, and despite the growing cultural
acceptance of furries, Peter does not want (most) sites to learn
or personalize content around his furry-interest.

## Principles for Vulnerable People

Some people, or groups of people, are at greater risk from the asymmetries of power created by the
concentration of information power ([[?Automating-Inequality]]). [=People=] who for whatever reason
are in a more [=vulnerable=] position with respect to data [=processing=] should be more proactively
protected by the [=user agent=] as well as by [=parties=].

One issue, however, is that signalling to [=parties=] that a [=person=] may be [=vulnerable=] is
itself a sensitive piece of information that should not be shared. One way to approach this issue is
to rely on a [=global opt-out=] mechanism such as [[?GPC]] that is used by [=people=] whether they
are [=vulnerable=] or not and puts a requirement on [=parties=] to minimise their [=data=]
[=processing=].

<div class="practice">

<span class="practicelab" id="principle-identity-per-context">[=User agents=] should support a mode
to specifically protect [=vulnerable=] people that defaults to sending a [=global opt-out=] signal
such as [[?GPC]].</span>

# EVERYTHING BELOW THIS LINE IS MATERIAL

See Privacy as Rules

ABOUT REASONING
A data system designed for people is one in which people remain effectively able to reason about
what is known about them. This means working to prevent hidden parties from acquiring such
information, preventing any party from acquiring too much information about a person particularly in
cross-referencing from multiple sources, restricting applications of this data that are hostile to
people. [this needs all kinds of better phrasing]

RULES ABOUT PARTIES
Privacy regulatory regimes are often anchored at extremes: either they default to allowing
only very few strictly essential [=purposes=] such that many [=parties=] will have to
resort to [=consent=], habituating [=people=] to ignore legal prompts and incentivising
[=dark patterns=], or, conversely, they default to forbidding only very few, particularly
egregious [=purposes=], such that [=people=] will have to perform the [=privacy labour=] to
[=opt out=] in every [=context=] in order to produce [=appropriate=] [=processing=].

# Common Concepts {#boring-terminology}

## People {#people}

A <dfn data-lt="individual|people|user|data subject">person</dfn> (also [=user=] or
[=data subject=]) is any natural person. Throughout this document, we primarily use [=person=] or
[=people=] to refer to human beings, as a reminder of their humanity. When we use the term [=user=],
it is to talk about the specific [=person=] who happens to be using a given system at that time.

A <dfn data-lt="vulnerable">vulnerable person</dfn> is a [=person=] who may be unable to
exercise sufficient self-determination in a [=context=]. Amongst other things, they should
be treated with greater default privacy protections and may be considered unable to
[=consent=] to various interactions with a system.
People can be vulnerable for different reasons, for example because they are children,
are employees with respect to their employers, are facing a steep asymmetry of power,
are people in some situations of intellectual or psychological impairment, are
refugees, etc.

A <dfn>context</dfn> is a physical or digital environment that a [=person=] interacts with
for a set of [=purposes=] (that they typically share with other [=people=] who interact with the
same environment).

## Server-Side Parties {#parties}

A <dfn>party</dfn> is an entity that a [=person=] can reasonably understand as a single "thing"
they're interacting with. Uses of this document in a particular domain are expected to describe how
the core concepts of that domain combine into a [=user=]-comprehensible [=party=], and those refined
definitions are likely to differ between domains.

The <dfn data-lt="first parties">first party</dfn> is a [=party=] with which a [=person=] intends to
interact. Merely hovering over, muting, pausing, or closing a given piece of content does
not mean a [=person=] intends to interact with another party, nor does the simple
fact of loading a [=party=] embedded in the one with which the person intends to
interact. In cases of clear and conspicuous joint branding, there can be multiple [=first
parties=]. The [=first party=] is necessarily a [=data controller=] of the data processing
that takes places as a consequence of a [=person=] interacting with it.

<aside class="issue">Refine the description of third parties so it matches
intuition better.</aside>

A <dfn data-lt="third parties">third party</dfn> is any [=party=] other than the [=person=] visiting the website,
the [=first party=], or a [=service provider=] acting on behalf of either the [=person=] or
the [=first party=].

## Acting on Data {#acting-on-data}

<dfn>Privacy</dfn> is achieved in a given [=context=] that either involves [=personal data=] or
involves information being presented to [=people=] when the [=principles=] of that [=context=] are
followed appropriately. When the [=principles=] for that [=context=] are not followed, there is a
<dfn>privacy violation</dfn>. Similarly, we say that a particular interaction is
<dfn data-lt="appropriately">appropriate</dfn> when the [=principles=] are adhered
to) or <dfn data-lt="inappropriately">inappropriate</dfn> otherwise.

A [=party=] <dfn data-lt="process|processing|processed|data processing">processes</dfn> data if it
carries out operations on [=personal data=], whether or not by automated means, such as
collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration,
retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, [=sharing=], dissemination or
otherwise making available, [=selling=], alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or
destruction.

A [=party=] <dfn data-lt="share|sharing">shares</dfn> data if it provides it to any other
[=party=]. Note that, under this definition, a [=party=] that provides data to its own
[=service providers=] is not [=sharing=] it.

A [=party=] <dfn data-lt="sell|selling">sells</dfn> data when it [=shares=] it in exchange
for consideration, monetary or otherwise.

The <dfn>purpose</dfn> of a given [=processing=] of data is an anticipated, intended, or
planned outcome of this [=processing=] which is achieved or aimed for within a given
[=context=]. A [=purpose=], when described, should be specific enough to be actionable by
someone familiar with the relevant [=context=] (ie. they could independently determine
[=means=] that reasonably correspond to an implementation of the [=purpose=]).

<!--
XXX given that contexts are defined from *user* purpose we might wish to have purpose in
general and processing purpose for the above.
-->

The <dfn>means</dfn> are the general method of [=data processing=] through which a given
[=purpose=] is implemented, in a given [=context=], considered at a relatively abstract
level and not necessarily all the way down to implementation details. Example:
<em>a person will have their preferences restored (purpose) by looking up their identifier
in a preferences store (means)</em>.

# High-Level Threats {#threats}

User agents should attempt to defend the people using them from a variety of high-level
threats or attacker goals, described in this section.

These threats are an extension of the ones discussed by [[RFC6973]].

<dl>
<dt><dfn>Surveillance</dfn>

<dd> Surveillance is the observation or monitoring of an individual’s
communications or activities. See <a
data-cite="RFC6973#section-5.1.1">RFC6973§5.1.1</a>.

<dt>Data Compromise

<dd> End systems that do not take adequate measures to secure data from
    unauthorized or inappropriate access. See <a
    data-cite="RFC6973#section-5.1.2">RFC6973§5.1.2</a>.

<dt><dfn>Intrusion</dfn>

<dd> [=Intrusion=] consists of invasive acts that disturb or interrupt one’s life or
    activities. See <a
    data-cite="RFC6973#section-5.1.3">RFC6973§5.1.3</a>.

<dt>Misattribution

<dd> Misattribution occurs when data or communications related to one individual
    are attributed to another. See <a
data-cite="RFC6973#section-5.1.4">RFC6973§5.1.4</a>.

<dt><dfn>Correlation</dfn>

<dd> Correlation is the combination of various pieces of information related to an
    individual or that obtain that characteristic when combined. See
    <a
data-cite="RFC6973#section-5.2.1">RFC6973§5.2.1</a>.

<dt>Profiling</dt>

<dd>The inference, evaluation, or prediction of an individual's attributes, interests, or
behaviours.</dd>

<dt><dfn>Identification</dfn>

<dd>Identification is the linking of information to a particular individual, even if the information
isn't linked to that individual's real-world identity (e.g. their legal name, address, government ID
number, etc.). Identifying someone allows a system to treat them differently from others, which can
be [=inappropriate=] depending on the [=context=]. See
<a data-cite="RFC6973#section-5.2.2">RFC6973§5.2.2</a>.

<dt><dfn>Secondary Use</dfn>

<dd> Secondary use is the use of collected information about an individual without
    the individual’s consent for a purpose different from that for which the
    information was collected. See <a
data-cite="RFC6973#section-5.2.3">RFC6973§5.2.3</a>.

<dt><dfn>Disclosure</dfn>

<dd>Disclosure is the revelation of information about an individual that affects
    the way others judge the individual. See <a
data-cite="RFC6973#section-5.2.4">RFC6973§5.2.4</a>.

<dt>Exclusion

<dd>Exclusion is the failure to allow individuals to know about the data that
    others have about them and to participate in its handling and use. See
    <a
data-cite="RFC6973#section-5.2.5">RFC6973§5.2.5</a>.

</dl>

These threats combine into the particular concrete threats we want web
specifications to defend against, described in the sections that follow.
