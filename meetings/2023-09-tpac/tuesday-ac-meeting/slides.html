      <p>
        When we add features to the web platform, we are making decisions that may
        change the ability of people to protect their personal data. This data
        includes their conversations, their financial transactions and how they live
        their lives. We will start by creating web technologies that create as few
        risks as possible, and will make sure people understand what risks they are
        taking when they use the web.

    <ul>
      <li
        title="Engineers work best when we have our design constraints up front, so this document describes those constraints.">
        Define privacy constraints for <strong>Web API designers</strong>.
      </li>
      <li title="API reviewers also benefit from a list of things to check for.">
        Help <strong>Web API reviewers</strong> check for privacy protections.

      <li
        title="Third, the web has norms around privacy that differ from other platforms. We're trying to explain those norms to site authors and groups in both civil society and government.">
        Explain web-wide norms around privacy to <strong>site authors</strong> and <strong>regulators</strong>.
      </li>
      <li
        title="Finally, we know that we'll keep discussing and arguing about privacy in the future. This document should give us some terminology and common ground on which to base those discussions.">
        <strong>Define the grounds</strong> on which we'll have future discussions about privacy.

      title="We don't want to imply that this document overrides other ethical principles if there are conflicts, and the document says that in a couple places.">
      Non-goal: override other ethical principles
