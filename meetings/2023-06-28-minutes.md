# TAG Privacy TF Minutes - 28 June 2023

Present: Robin, Don, Nick, Pete, Jeffrey, Amy

## [Remove the statement about a general opt-out overriding a specific opt-in.](https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles/pull/238)

Robin: Discussion in 238 or 231 - prvoided an alternative in https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles/pull/296 

Pete: in last sentence - maybe preference instead of decision?

Robin: goal is to clarify the conceptual part. "as if the user were constructing the ua to do this for this purpose" and removing the regulatory language.

Jeffrey: want to run this by Michael Kleber.  User has instructed the browser... if a site thinks they have a reason where maybe the user's pref doesn't apply then can ignore but site does nead that reason. 

Robin: yes ... don't want to go down a full path of mapping out all the cases.

Jeffrey: will make suggestions to tweak the wording.

Jeffrey: been thinking about cookie consent into the browser... what would that look like? needs the ability for the site to say "wait, i'm special". I feel like this text does align. But I want to review.

Robin: Idea is to be compatible with ADPC. https://www.dataprotectioncontrol.org/

## [Fingerprinting](https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles/pull/274)

Robin: yes

Nick: yes

Pete: what's he concerned about?  Exposing one bit in session one and one in session 2?

Nick: more trying to explain to the reader how fingerprinting is accomplished.

Dan: yes looks good.

**agree to merge**

## [no excuses for fingerprinting](https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles/pull/275)

Nick: change might be reasonable...  We don't need to get into the size...

Dan: I like it.

Robin. +1

Pete: +1

Nick: we could move it to a specific document... 

**agree to merge**

## [principle for non-user privacy, to be able to access and remove data uploaded by others](https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles/pull/287)

Nick: adds a principle but pretty short otherwise... 

Robin: [some editorial]

Robin: I like the overall thing.

Robin: if people like the general thing i'm happy with nick making exec decision and merging.

Jeffrey: +1

**agreed to merge**

## [transparency](https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles/pull/288)

Nick: adds a section of principles on transparency... Included citations... Requesting review. 

**we agree to review and return to this next week**

## [small group privacy examples](https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles/pull/289)

Nick: small changes but I want feedback...  Is targeting messages to a small group inappropriate in a privacy way?  The last time we had general targetting to demographics we had objections... 

Dan: concern about adding material to the doc which has been criticized for being too long.

Jeffrey: I think this is new and useful. I will run this by the privacy sandbox folks... i think this is compatible.

Don: I'm not sure about "small" - e.g. targetting a message to everyone in town who did not go to lunch in Ramadan.. that could be large but still sensitive... 

Robin: that's a sensitive - religious addiliation - category. I think flagging the small group - even for things that aren't considered sensitive.. is the issue.

Robin: +1

Don: are we including data from which a sensitive characteristic can be inferred? Will re-check and make sure it is covered 

Don: +1

Dan: +1

**agree to merge**

## [fake consent](https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles/pull/290)

Robin: editorial...  

Robin: last sentence... on time spent on reading privacy policy... 

Don: we don't want people to do unsustainable amounts of privacy labour - but some sites might have unavoidable personal data processing...

Nick: Agree with the intent - but the 2nd principle just elaborates...

Jeffrey: sometimes the site should just not ask... ?  If we could work it under the first section that would be better.

Don: will do a new version that moves this to explanatory text for the first principle... and remove numbers of minutes

Jeffrey: also on the same page as Robin that a 30 min privacy policy is too much for any site... 

## [self-governing](https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles/pull/291)

Robin: +1

Jeffrey: I want to let Michael have a chance to review.

**we can merge async based on that review**

## [style](https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles/pull/292/files)

Robin: editorial...

**agree to merge**

## [Add centralization section](https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles/pull/293)

Pete: agree to Robin's changes....

Nick: agree with general idea - but concerned with adding that to this document... 

Jeffrey: I think this is an EWP rathr than a privacy principle...

Robin: I like the part that gives the articulation... 

Dan: suggest we close - and open an issue on EWP.

Pete: will do. [pes: https://github.com/w3ctag/ethical-web-principles/pull/95]

**agree to close and close 261 but file issue in EWP**

## [registries](https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles/pull/294)

Robin: we agreed on this .. 

Nick: I like this though concerned about the length...

Pete: could we state in a positive form?

Jeffrey: we could merge and do an editing pass...

## Editing Pass

Robin: I can take intro...  Let's split stuff up.

Don: I can open an issue per section .... 

Amy: top level sections...

Robin: x.x 

Don: **to make issues** (including for text not in a numbered section)

## [Purpose-built API](https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles/pull/295)

Nick: I'm supportive...

Dan: +1

Pete: we could lose the first 2 sentence ... to cut length.  

**We agree to leave it to robin and lose first para to merge**
