Jeffrey: noting a conflict ... "revoked" - martin complained that information can't be revoked... 

Dan: Yes I think that makes sense...

Nick: ...does it remove separate principle text of guardaians & wards?...  I guess it's fine.

**so squashed**

## https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles/pull/325

Don: I'm concerned we're leaving the surevillance advertising industry an out because they can claim that surveillance advertising / relevant advertising is in the user interest.  You can claim that cross-context behavioral advertising raises web sites' revenue so therefore it's in the user's interest (because they receive more ad-supported content than they would without it)

Jeffrey: sometimes we have to balance different user interests...

Robin: Some people will always make claims about indirect user benefits and use potentially dubious research in support of that. We can't pre-emptively address bad faith.

Dan: is there something we can say about "direct vs. indirect user benefit"...

Don: cross-site tracking has multiple effects on the market for web ads, some of the literature only captures one side (higher revenue where a cookie is present than not present) and not the other side (cross-site tracking artificially increases supply of ad inventory by making sites that are harmful to users monetizable)

Jeffrey: all of this is separate from the changes in 325...
