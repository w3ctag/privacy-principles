# TAG Privacy TF Minutes

Present: Dan, Jeffrey, Christine, Tess, Robin, Nick, Wendy

Regrets: Sam, Don

## [sarcasm](https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles/pull/234)

Robin: this makes the doc more dry and less readable but not opposed.

Nick: substantively I've wanted a change like this. I don't think it's just because of the change since the 1970s...

Jeffrey: arguably..

**agree to merge**

## [236](https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles/pull/236) / [242](https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles/pull/242) on purposes

duelling PRs

Robin: both replace the idea of burden of proof - which evokes cours - with the idea that actors should take care of consent. The difference is that jeffrey keeps it about purposes but remove sensitive - i keep sensitive but make it about processing.... 

Jeffrey: I don't feel strongly about the *sensitive* bit. I think if we talk about processing we would need a matching bit in the first para.

Robin: i feel that's fair. 

Jeffrey: we also suggested different text for processing last week... if we stay with processing we should take the text we talked about last week. https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles/issues/229#issuecomment-1479981172

Robin: that text works for me...

Nick: looking at purposes vs processing - looking at opt in/ opt out def... only thing changes is number of purposes... it's not right...   So I like Robin's PR plus jeffrey's amendment. 

Jeffrey; I'm fine with that.

**we agree to progress/update 242 and deprecate 236**

## [Remove "unprecedented"](https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles/pull/237)

Dan: I support removing

Christine: Me too.
