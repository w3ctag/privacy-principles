## [Make it clearer that disloyalty must be detrimental to people #269](https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles/pull/269)

Jeffrey brings up the https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/blob/main/explainer.md holdback option as an example of a browser refusing to provide some information, where providing that information would be in the user's interest, but potentially against the interest of other users or the web overall. Is this disloyal, and is it something browsers should avoid doing?

Robin suggests filing an issue about using the document to analyze this complicated case.

## [Clarifying identity vs legal identity #270](https://github.com/w3ctag/privacy-principles/pull/270)

Jeffrey: Is eye color part of a legal identity, or is legal identity just the lookup keys?

Robin: Everything recorded on identity documents is part of the legal identity.
