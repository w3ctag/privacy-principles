## Why Privacy

The Web is for everyone. This means that it needs to be built to serve people and to serve human
values. One of the ways in which the Web can serve people is by protecting them in the face of
asymmetries of power.

Information is power. It can be used to predict and to influence people, as well as to design online
spaces that control people's behaviour. What's more, automation renders information more efficient.

Privacy is about the rules that govern information flows, and more precisely it is about how these
rules constrain and distribute the power of information between different actors. Struggles over
privacy are struggles over the rules that govern the power of data, they are about data governance.
The focus of this document concerns leveraging this power differential against people, but the same
techniques are also used to leverage the power of information against other entities, such as
companies or governments.

There are always privacy rules — the question is which ones best serve human values. So privacy is
_instrumental_ to using data in service of a space designed _for_ everyone.

A data system designed for people is one in which people remain effectively able to reason about
what is known about them. This means working to prevent hidden parties from acquiring such
information, preventing any party from acquiring too much information about a person particularly in
cross-referencing from multiple sources, restricting applications of this data that are hostile to
people. [this needs all kinds of better phrasing]

* automation asymmetry
* Opt-in, Out, Consent, Global opt out
* Personal Control and Autonomy (parts of)
* dark patterns
* privacy labour

## What Is Privacy

Establishing privacy as rules for the power of data within an institutional framework, using CI to
describe rule system, agents, structures. This might benefit from some Ostrom too. Keep in mind to
make context a set of purposes.

* The Parties
  * party, first party, third party
  * service provider or processor
  * data controller
* Contexts & Privacy
  * purpose, means
  * context (and sub-notions)
  * defining privacy
  * tracking

## How To Implement Privacy

A principled overview of how to make the rules real.

### Privacy Threats on the Web

* High-Level Threats
* Unwanted Cross-Context Recognition
* Sensitive information disclosure
* Unexpected profiling
* Intrusive behavior
* Powerful capabilities
* vulnerable person (considering including here as a threat similar to a11y failures: people who
design in ablist ways — otherwise it can go next to dark patterns above)

### It's _Your_ Browser

What the UA can do to protect from asymmetries.

* User Agents
  * trustworthy and related

### Browser Protections

This is a discussion of what we can expect browsers to do.

* Identity
  * cross-context recognition
  * machine-enforceable context, partition

### Data Processor Protections

This is a discussion of some practices that entities processing data can apply, not all of them
good.

* de-identified and controlled de-identified
* FIPs
* Vegas Rule

### Data Governance

This covers the rules & institutions that might not be supported directly by browsers, but that we
expect from hunman-centric systems that. Also how this relates to trust and how trust gets created.

This would include collective governance for security systems. Maybe also mention that consent is
individualistic and imbalances of power can often be best redressed using collective tools.

* Collective Issues
  * POSIWID
  * legibility
  * legitimate & illegitimate
  * reflexivity
  * data governance

## Appendix: Common Concepts

This section contains definitions for terms mentioned in the document that are not defined before
they are used. The idea is that, if a term is common enough that people will naturally understand it
but that it could nevertheless benefit from a strict definition in order to provide a common
foundation for debate, then it goes here.

* person
* personal data
* processes, shares, sells
