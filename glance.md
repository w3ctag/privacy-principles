# Privacy Principles for the Web at a Glance

## Status

This document is designed to be a very short summary of what a reader will find in [Privacy Principles](https://www.w3.org/TR/privacy-principles/). This document reflects no consensus. Ian Jacobs wondered whether it would be helpful. 

## Introduction

The TAG's [Ethical Web Principles](https://www.w3.org/TR/ethical-web-principles/) state:

> When we add features to the web platform, we are making decisions that
impact peoples' ability to control their personal data. The overall
goal of privacy on the web is served best when technology and law
complement one another.

The [Privacy Principles](https://www.w3.org/TR/privacy-principles/)
Note (below called "the document") endeavors to establish shared
concepts as an aid to technical efforts to ensure privacy on the
web. It may also be useful in pursuing alignment with and between
legal regulatory regimes.

## The Privacy Challenge

The collection and processing of information in greater volume, with
greater precision and reliability, with increasing interoperability
across a growing variety of data types, and at intensifying speed is
leading to a concentration of power that threatens private and public
liberties. What's more, automation and the increasing computerisation
of all aspects of our lives both increase the power of information and
decrease the cost of a number of intrusive behaviours that would be
more easily kept in check if the perpetrator had to be in the same
room as the victim. An appendix in the document identifies a full set
of high-level threats that inform the subsequent guidance.

The principles in this document provide guidance to address these
challenges. The principles build on some concepts and terminology
introduced in the first half of the document, such as: **asymmetry**
(the imbalance of power between end users), **privacy labour** (the
effort individuals must exert in order to protect their privacy),
**surveillance** risks, the increased **vulnerability** of some
populations to privacy threats, and **collective privacy** (e.g.,
revealing information about group membership). An appendix of "common
concepts" seeks to bolster shared understanding of the model behind
the principles.

Importantly, the document makes explicit assumptions about browser
duties with respect to the user: protection, discretion, honesty, and
loyalty. The principles assume that the browser (or other user agent)
will act as a trustworthy agent on the user's behalf.

## The Principles

The document lists 30 general principles in the following categories:

* Identity on the Web
* Data Minimization
* Information access
* Sensitive Information
* Data Rights
* De-identified Data
* Collective Privacy
* Device Owners and Administrators
* Protecting web users from abusive behaviour
* Purpose limitation
* Transparency
* Consent, Withdrawal of Consent, Opt-Outs, and Objections
* Notifications and Interruptions
* Non-Retaliation
* Support Choosing Which Information to Present

Each principle is accompanied by explanatory material, examples, and
guidance for how to adhere to the principle.

Here are some examples:

* A user agent should help its user present the identity they want in
 each context they are in, and should prevent or support recognition
 as appropriate. (Identity on the Web)

* Sites, user agents, and other actors should restrict the data they
 transfer to what's either necessary to achieve their users' goals or
 aligns with their users' wishes and interests. (Data Minimization)

* System designers should not assume that particular information is or
 is not sensitive. Whether information is considered sensitive can
 vary depending on a person's circumstances and the context of an
 interaction, and it can change over time. (Sensitive Information)

The document includes a summary of all of the principles.
